While it is a decent learning tool (the letters light up brightly and the voice is clear in it's pronunciation), the drum portion is absolutely useless. When set on the drum setting, banging on it only produces the faintest little tapping noise while lights stream across the top. Those lights will hold his attention for a few minutes, but once he sees that he can't make much noise with it, it gets pushed aside. Overall, I can't say I recommend this. The idea was a good one, but they just didn't execute it very well. If you're looking for a drum, buy a drum.

He is 8 months old now and can't quite get the mail into the box himself, but loves to pull it out.  He gets excited when he opens the box.  He recently began to enjoy the buzzing bee also.  I know that when he is older and understands the concept of mail, he will enjoy it more.  It is definitely very durable, but is easily pulled onto the child (my son has done so a few times).  But, it doesn't seem to hurt him.  I rated it 3 stars for fun, because it doesn't hold his interest for long periods of time.", "overall": 3.0}
{"text": "BEST BATMAN GAME EVER\nBatman Arkham City is one of my all time favorite Batman games included the SNES Batman Returns. The graphics are beautiful and perfect. The controls are the same from Arkham Asylum and this game had new weapons like the freeze bombs and the REC cannon. This game had many dlcs like Catwoman, Robin, and Nightwing bundles also Harley Quinn's Revenge. This game had many boss characters like Solomon Grundy, Ra`s Al Ghul, Joker, Clayface, Deadshot, Two-Face, and Mr. Freeze. This game had different awards included Top 100 Video Games of all Time, and it had better ranks. I recommended that you buy Arkham Asylum and Arkham City if you are a die hard Batman fan and trust me you will not regret your decision.", "overall": 5.0}

I gave it all a good tugging and all parts feel very secure.  No batteries to worry about getting loose.  All edges are rounded and smooth.  I look forward to adding more WOW toys to the toy chest.My advice about this one is to bring this out after nap time since it could wake you out of a coma. After her nap until we eat dinner is the perfect window to be noisy and get excited about this fun toy.  I look forward to this toy getting lots of playtime from my son in months/years to come too since I think it will last a long time -- it feels as sturdy as it is loud.Great gift idea!", "overall": 4.0}

The phone does not light up in different colors and does not have a colored screen but my son doesn't mind at all. The phone also is not annoying, when the buttons are pushed the phone makes a dial tone noise or will say the number pushed. I think the phone will be great when he is older to learn numbers too.

Until now all toys were fun.The benefit of this toy is that it includes 3 medium size round containers of a fun-to-manipulate clay-like substance.The demerits of this toy include the fact that it's not like the illustrations on the box. The board is really a relatively small section of cardboard. It looks and feels cheap. The castle(s) cannot be built because the material to do so is the clay substance and there's not nearly enough of it for that purpose.I felt that the molds were not that serviceable because it's unlikely children like mine will use them more than once.Finally, the catapults shoot the clay all over and cannot really be used to shoot at such close range. The balls of clay then can potentially become a mess. Mainly the gap between the box illustration and the contents was too large.", "overall": 2.0}

She also customizes the intruder alert with snarky messages for the rest of us. She was giddy with the invisible ink and black light. It isn't really a journal (since the writing area is too small for deep thoughts) or a secure diary (since the reset button can be accessed with a pen), but she still enjoys writing short notes, invisible sketches, and securing her treasures from her little bother.

There is an ear piece that allows you to hear what is going on, but while the ATV is moving it some how effects the sound and you can't hear anything. However, you can still see while it is moving.It's fairly durable as far as the ATV itself. You have a huge antennae sticking up and that is not durable.

More complicated games have you taking control with different colored pieces where there is some strategy involved.I played this with my 5 year old and although I did a lot better than her, we leveled the playing field by letting her take five shots before I started.It would have been nice to have a third or fourth color so you could play with more than one person.

IR sensor faces rear of bird, so if signal doesn't bounce off awall when it faces you, the heli free falls.  I've had it shut down a few feet from me (facing me) in a 2 car garage.-  Non-removable battery with 30 minutes recharge time-  Any air currents (heater) will give a wild ride.-  If you plan on moving to more complex helicopters, the 3 ch controller will end up confusing you later on.", "overall": 3.0}

My son is now 16-months-old and he walks really well, but he's still not interested in this toy. A few times I've seen him try to play with it, but he just lifts the \"leash\" up and ends up carrying the dog around... instead of \"walking\" the dog.

Also, for it to work well you need to be in an extremely small room.  We use it in our half bath because the \"stars\" don't project well in a normal room.Not sorry I bought it, but it isn't all that great.

Looking at the picture here, I believe they may have redesigned since we got our son one 6 months ago as the chute attaches differently as pictured.

The music is HORRIBLY loud.  We have to turn it off if we're trying to watch TV and son is playing in the room.  Many musical toys have at least a low and high volume switch.  This one desperately needs one!!On the positive, our son does love to watch the balls and grab at them as they pop out or go down the chute.  He will chase the balls when they go flying.

Part of the reason for mentioning that is that the packaging is definitely a bit on the weak side.  The package arrived to me crumpled a bit having been crushed up some in the shipping process (or in the warehouse before it was ever shipped).  This isn't meant to be a collectible (at least I don't think it was), and that is OK, but perhaps a little extra care and extra work in the package could help change that.Transforming works easily enough to leave a good bit of fun in the form of this toy.

I have to agree with some of the other reviewers that Fisher Price should have included more animals without the consumer having to buy them and pay extra. Also, I feel that it's very limited as far as what your child can do with it, it's just not that versatile and especially with modern technology, I think that a child would get bored very quickly with this toy.As far as the structure itself, the plastic pieces are thick and feel pretty sturdy and it was fairly easy to put it together.

When you get the matches, you earn coins and whoever has the most coins at the end of the game wins. My children felt like they found a treasure chest with this game. It arrived just in time for spring break and they have been playing it nonstop. Its a great game to encourage math skills and lots of fun for the whole family. While I am prefer the real board game to the digital version, for those of you who enjoy virtual games, Bejeweled also includes three exclusive download codes that are valid through 12/31/13.", "overall": 4.0}

Each doll has a slot at the back where wings can be attached (though not all dolls come with wings).  They all have the same mold, though painted differently and with different hair.The dolls can pretty much stand on their own - so they make great displays when not in play.Note that the hair does get ratty easy in the back, and that's why I rate this 4 out of 5 stars.", "overall": 4.0}

I knew what was going on, so to me it was quite entertaining to see the reactions. It definitely brought some 'spice' to the gathering.

The stacker looks pretty with the rings on, but when the rings are off, the white light is a little too bright for my taste.  If you want an educational toy, get a regular non-musical stacker instead and if you want a musical toy, I'm sure there are ones on the market that do more than have just 2 buttons and play songs, but this does not encourage the child to learn how to stack the rings.", "overall": 3.0}

I think this set could be improved by using a wooden dowel on the wand instead of a plastic stick, and ribbon in lieu of the plastic-y wrapping type of ribbon it has on the headpiece and wand (the plastic-y ribbon tends to tangle).All in all, this is a very nice set.

Plus it goes along with other toys the kids love - tent, lantern, etc.  We own all that stuff.The problem is, this thing has a fan that makes noise. The fan is what's used to make the flame look mildly realistic.  Why they went this route is beyond me.  Maybe it was to save money.  They could have come up with a quieter mechanical design with a rotating device and a light bulb that changed colors like glowing embers.  Maybe this would have been less dramatic.  Well, kids aren't that stupid.  They know a fan when they see/hear one.  Totally destroys the imagination.  Perhaps YMMV with your children.  Just wasn't impressed by this. Still, I'll give it three stars for a low price.  If you can afford to pay more for something more realistic then definitely do so.", "overall": 3.0}

You can hit the different letters and it will tell you an animal that starts with that letter. And it has another function that makes the letter sounds. That's it as far as I can see. My daughter already knows these things. The customizable part is pretty cute, but nothing more than saying your child's name and reading a few short e-mails that are already written for you.  This does not hold any interest for her. I would send it back, but for $20 I don't know if it's worth it!

It does well on the road and in the grass unless he gets in the tall grass.  The grass bogs it down.  The tires are nice and large, allowing it to handle heavier terrain than I thought it would.  The remote works well and has some distance to it.  I wish it had more than one speed, but that's not a big deal.  My biggest issue, and the reason this got four stars instead of five, is the battery usage.  A rechargeable battery would have been much better. I would be willing to pay a little more for that feature.  Overall, a fun remote control vehicle.", "overall": 4.0}
{"text": "GREAT QUALITY, PLASTIC CASE, AND MY TODDLER LOVES THEM!\nFrom the mother of a 2.5 year-old:First, let me say that I didn't realize these came in a plastic case. This is so great, since my son tends to rip apart the typical paper/cardboard crayon boxes on the first day. The case has a clear lid w/ a hinge, and placeholders (little cut-ins that the pointed edge of the triangle can sit it) for each crayon which make it really easy for my son to constantly put them into and then take out of the box over and over.As far as the quality of the crayons, these have not broken yet and appear to be very difficult to break (provided we can keep them away from the dog, of course). The crayons are thicker and longer than the Crayola triangular crayons, which we've come to learn break very easily. I think the number of crayons in the set (10) is perfect - it provides a good variety of colors to choose from.I highly recommend these crayons. Try them, you'll be impressed!

IMHO, that was more of a novelty than anything else -- it was fun once, but I'm not any more likely to buy an augmented puzzle next time now that I've tried it once.

{"text": "A GAME OF CHANCE\nHi Ho Cherry-O is a game of chance that includes cute little red cherries.  Gameplay is very simple.  You just spin the spinner and whatever number the arrow lands on is how many cherries you receive.  But if you land on a dog or bird, you lose all of your cherries.  The player with the most cherries wins.  Aimed toward the preschool and kindergarten level, this colorful game teaches counting, as well as good sportsmanship.  And parents can be free of guilt, since the game is up to chance, so you're not really lying when your child asks if you let them win!  I recommend this game to little ones who aren't quite ready for the big-kid games.", "overall": 3.0}

Particularly helpful was the first step, showing how to organize all the parts in advance. That ensured nothing was missing, and also helped with knowing what to use in each later stepOne important learning since yesterday is that what I considered spare parts, because they are not used by the design in the instructions are usable in additional design ideas viewable at the K'nex Web site.One other fun idea is to combine parts from both sets, to build something personal and original.(See photos too.)", "overall": 4.0}

This is a small little unfolding house with five buttons that make different sounds (telephone ring, two different water sounds for the washing machine and the bathtub, a toilet flush, and a doorbell) and two little \"people\", one of which is a baby.  There are some cute features, I'm glad my daughter has this, but it is nowhere near the $40ish current list price.  I would judge this as a $25 toy.  With some upgrades (more buttons/features) and more people in it, I would judge the price appropriate.

This is odd, because our son has not chewed on the toy at all.  I am returning this to Amazon as \"defective\", because I will not give our son a toy that he could ingest paint from.

He can do it, but it takes quite a few tries.- The arm of the dinosaur doesn't attach. It fell off immediately, and is now lost. Pretty poor.- It's just kind of cheesy.

You must still try to get certain number of spreads, i.e. full house, small & large straights, etc., but which spread you get depends on a draw of the cards.  Yes, CARDS.  Instead of the handy score pad, you and up to three others must roll the die at the same time in hopes of winning a spread listed on one of 9 cards and activating the 5 second timer.  Once you press the timer, opponents have 5 seconds to achieve a spread and lock in their points.  If you aren't fast enough, you lose.  Sounds complicated, but it's pretty simple and extremely fun.

My planes flew as well or better than ones made from ordinary copy paper and were good looking, but not exciting enough to encourage any of us to make more.Since the paper is heavier than copy paper, it would seem you could get a plane that would fly better outside than one made with standard paper, so if you're into paper airplanes (whatever your age) this set of bright paper sheets might provide a fun alternative to standard paper.  Making a good one seems to take a deft hand, however.", "overall": 3.0}

I don't know how much he absorbs when he presses the letters and hears the words, but this is one of his favorite toys.  He will sit and play with the keys and the letters for at least 10+ minutes.So if you're wondering if this will work with your 12 or 18 month old, go for it.That said, I don't think it's too babyish for 2 or 3 either.  It's very basic with broad appeal.  Nice bright \"buttons\" (they aren't actually raised) that sound music or words in a cheerful voice when you press them.  This makes a perfectly fine present for a 1 year old too, imo.  They will start to learn when they are ready, but won't be bored in the meantime either.", "overall": 5.0}

It's very nice and sturdy, and I love that it's ecofriendly and nontoxic. The bottles also are a very nice size for small hands.If there are down sides, it would be that the larger bottles are heavy because they are solid wood. If you have a toy-thrower or slammer, that could cause some injuries or damage to tabletops. (My girls tend to be gentle, but I wouldn't be surprised if we get a few goose eggs from these over the years.) The tops to the honey and the yogurt also come off, which is nice for play, but they only set on top of the jars.

The flame is made of cloth and there is a fan inside that blows to make the cloth flame dance and move around to look like a real flame. It is a neat effect, but the noise is kind of aggravating. It's kind of a buzzing motor sound, not as quiet or soft as a regular fan's sound. It's too bad because this could have been a fun night light to use if your kids had a sleep over or wanted to leave it on all night, pretending to sleep around a camp fire.

Also, all the things that go on top - the Super Fast, helicopter and antenna attachments - come off very easily, so they fall off constantly while our sons are playing with them.  We've also noticed that some of the paint is already wearing off the nose of Rocket and we've only had them for six days. Not a good sign.The best thing about this toy is the program feature.

The assembly is somewhat intensive, requiring tools and muscles, and if you don't follow the minimal, ambiguous, visual directions exactly right the first time, you will ruin it. This toy is cheaply made and badly designed. I bought it for my 18-month-old who is jealous of his older sister's bike, but the wheels are too cheaply made to be useful outside. Although this bike fits him, he does not ride it, perhaps because the front wheel does not turn and the wheels do not roll easily and smoothly.

Good range and very fun to operate.The vehicle has a rechargeable battery pack (5.5 hours first time, 4 hours after that) and the remote uses disposable AA batteries.

The younger one had to be shown the pedal, but once he got the hang of it, he was all over the place; laughing and loving it.

A Large Group of People - Party Gras shows a minimum of 4 players, but that is too small a group to play. Party Gras is best played with a group of 10 or more.2. People willing to be goofy. - You really have to lose your inhabitions playing Party Gras. If you have some party poopers, afraid to look foolish, then they will hate this game.3. Adult Beverages - This can REALLY help with loosening people up.The whole idea of Party Gras is to complete tasks given on a card - For instance getting another player to ask you to lower your voice, meaning you have to begin talking loudly until someone asks you to quiet down. To win the gamye you have to collect beads from other players while giving yours away. But in reality, Party Gras's main purpose is get folks laughing and having a good time, it's not really about winning or losing.", "overall": 3.0}

The game is fun, fast and plays good with any number of players. Light to medium strategy with a bit of randomness.  The set up time to start and end is a little bit of a downer for me. It is kind one of those roller coaster in any popular park; long time waiting in line for an under a minute ride.  I personally prefer Vaccarinos's Kingdom Builder.

Other transformers actually let you transform which is the whole point, right??!!!!  This is like a McDonald's Happy Meal toy.  If you try to move any part it immediately pops off.  The ONLY cool part is how she looks when not Arachnid.  When she is in disguise she looks great.  Once you make any attempt to transform her or play w/ her you will be extremely DISAPPOINTED.  I was surprised b/c we have so many Transformers & play w/ them over & over & over.  Avoid this one & go w/ other Transformers.  Only way I would get is if you are a collector & just have to have it for your collection.  If you intend to \"transform\" it won't work & all you'll be is upset & disappointed as will the child.

The 6 inch size lends well to the articulation and detail of the figure.  When Hasbro goes to a larger size (12 inch), they tend to get chunky but not this time.  I have been very impressed with the 6 inch line and intend to collect more of them.  Maul comes with several accessories.  I love that you can take the attached-head-cloak piece completely off and put the single head on providing you with a whole other figure.

There is a switch changing the play from daytime to nighttime, which expands all the songs and learning features that are available. There is a radio on the farm, which even makes static noises like a radio occasionally does. There are lots of songs that this farm plays!

The Werewolf ears are loose clip-ons, they flop around, and slide out of the hair when the doll is just standing there.  Having peg holes in the head, and space in the wig cap to insert ears with pegs would have worked much better.  The wig is a lower quality than LIV wigs, and is kind of a hot mess.

Parents and siblings teach babies to count to ten on their fingers and toes.  That human interaction is essential, and children shouldn't be expecting electronics' stimulation every minute.  Also, the sing-song counting will be very annoying to parents, very quickly.It's no surprise that Gund has moved in this direction, since everyone wants to ensure their kids are ready for standardized tests at an early age.

Most 3ch coaxial heli's (It doesn't matter who makes them) won't fly outdoors in any wind without doing a modification to the tail rotor blade. Even after the tail rotor mod, they won't fly in a lot of wind. You would thing that the manufactures of these large 3ch coaxial heli's would listen to the shortcomings of these otherwise fairly decent heli's and put a larger tail rotor motor and blade on them.", "overall": 5.0}

Also it is very flexible in terms of number of players, as it can be 2-10. I have even played it solo (practice mode?) and even then is quite fun.

The reading level is a bit too easy for my 6-year-old niece who reads well already. But it's a good challenge for the 4 and 5-year-olds.

I didn't expect them to fly straight or have much in the way of aiming accuracy, so that was fine, but my 7-year old has trouble pulling the mechanism.  I don't know if ours is just extra tight, but for a toy rated five years and over, I think the firing mechanism should be a bit easier to pull.  The darts do go quite far - we've had up to 15 feet.

We played several games that included throwing and catching the ball and kicking the ball.  It was fun.  The ball is light weight and easy to throw.  It is also squishy enogh to make it easy to catch and not to hurt if it hurts a body part.  The \"handle\" holes make it easy to hold the ball for throwing.

I don't mind that so much, especially with how much my 3 year old loved this truck. Now he's almost 5 and still loves it.  The beauty lies in the simplicity.  Any kid can run this truck.  Range stinks and it doesn't like pile carpet too much but for $20, who cares.You can remove the truck body and just run the chassis like a dune buggy.  It looks goofy but goes a little faster and is a little easier on the batteries since it's lighter.", "overall": 4.0}

Other flaw IMHO it's it didn't allow your baby to move feet under the toy ..  so he or she will need to stand little to much behind the toy when attempting to walk behind it.", "overall": 4.0}

For a camera that costs this much, I at least expect image quality to be as good as an average 1 MP phone camera.  It doesn't even come close.  Images are completely blurry to the point that my daughter can barely recognize the subject of the picture.Most new digital cameras today are over 10 megapixels.  It makes sense to only have a kid's first camera be at a low resolution.  Better to spend money at making the camera durable and adding some kid friendly features while keeping the price at a reasonable level.  I get that.  But, we're talking about resolution that was out 10 years ago.

He is skinnier, and his weapon is tiny compared to other two-handed guns that others carry.Broken:  The joint that holds his left leg snapped off as I was trying to move it.  I am gentle with all of the action figures from McFarlane since they tend to paint completed figures and they tend to stick a little anyway.  The leg did not have a chance.  So, it has been glued on to a stationary position, and now he can only stand.That being said, the armor is neat looking and different than the other Halo figures.

So if you rolled a 6 and a 2, it would be 6 squared. Then you have 3 scoring dice with 6 sides. With those scoring dice you roll 3 different numbers. You combine those 3 numbers to get as close as you can to the Target answer.I know they put ages on these games, but my youngest even had fun playing.

However, the string didn't last as long as the picnic and we were left holding a pull-string toy with no more pull-string.

(Each 75' roll is less than 2 1/2\" in diameter.)- It wrinkles easily.- It seems to come apart more easily when wet (for example from painting with water colors or drooling) than other craft papers.- It's not as smooth, even right off the roll, as similar roll paper I've worked with.Bottom line:  Depends on what you want it for.

It was our favorite color of red. After I had apologized to my grand daughter for breaking her crayon, the same thing happened to her. She moved the yellow crayon with just enough force that the crayon broke into thirds. We looked at each other, and then we smiled. We knew it must be a defect of these crayons.  It is too bad, the 16 colors are wonderful, lovely colors, easy to wash if a mark gets on the wrong thingy. But, it is difficult to be very gentle with crayons. Anything a child plays with, must be sturdy enough not to break. We now have 14 crayons after two days of use. How long will it take for them all to break?Not Really Recommended. prisrob 02-15-14", "overall": 3.0}
{"text": "FUN WHILE IT LAST.\nAir Hogs has been a staple at our house for ten years, especially at Christmas. This is similar to the typical Air Hog, but it has a &#34;kicker,&#34; the Battle Tracker. As for myself, I can barely fly the helicopter and it really becomes difficult with the Tracker and Firing Disc.I found it hard to use and easy to break. I would not recommend buying this as a beginner. I would start with the basic Air Hogs helicopter that are much less complicated and less expensive. Also from my experience, Air Hogs do not last long, especially with smaller children. They are easily broken due to the light weight of the products. They consume or eat batteries. It is nothing more than a toy for older children and adults so &#34;it is what it is.&#34; However, they are fun while they last.", "overall": 3.0}

We tried rechargable batteries first, as we go through batteries so quickly in our house rechargables seem the only way to go.  Rechargables do not power this toy at all, you have to use regular, and it drains batteries FAST.  Even with regular batteries, we could only get the trunk half inflated, so the butterflies never came out.Next, the nets:  cheap, flimsy and easily torn.  Far worse though, they're just the right size to get around kids' necks, which is a serious danger.  The net can be easily tightened but not so easily loosened, which only adds to the danger.In short, quite a let-down, and not worth the money.", "overall": 2.0}

The clothing detail and paint job is pretty good, and articulation points are very few and weak.

They dig where they're not supposed to, and they move dirt to where it doesn't belong.We got two of these as gifts for my girls and they are super cute but they are plastic, kind of junky and clunky, and let's just face it - kids young enough for this to be suitable are NOT going to garden - truly - and kids old enough to garden deserve better tools.Even just for plain old fun digging in the dirt - kids deserve better tools.

He played with it several times per day everyday for several months, until he was nearly two.  One blue connector peg did need to be re-glued, but there were no other issues as mentioned in other reviews.  We have lost several of the blocks and I would consider buying another set because its that good.  If your child likes to do puzzles, pull things, hook things together, this is a great toy.

While its a nice idea to have a pushbar (and how it would have come in handy when my daughter was a bit younger)...its definitely not a necessity and causes my daughter not to want to pedal the bike.  The bike seemed to be in good condition but was not as easy to manuever as the one we own (Radio Flyer Retro).  I think this one is over priced (because its a Kettrike) and not as durable as our Radio Flyer.  Not to mention all the kids ran to the Radio Flyer instead of this one.  As for the age range on the bike ... I'm not sure how it claims 1 to 6.  I personally think 1 is a little too young to get the concept of pedaling (regardless of the pushbar or not) and 6 I think they'd be a bit too big.  I'd go elsewhere and find a different tricycle!

Here's what *I* like about it:It transforms pretty easily - you just pull on each wing and it pretty much changes shape all by itself.It comes with a transformer guy so my son was able to start playing with it right away.There is a lot of detail in its construction, which I'm sure helps with his imaginative play.Here are some (minor) cons:The character that comes with it transforms into some kind of lunar rover or something, but it's pretty lame.The set has two laser canons on the front, but only one of them fires. I was just designed that way, but my son finds it weird that one of them \"doesn't work\"---Overall, I think this is a great toy that any Transformers fan would enjoy.", "overall": 4.0}

She did like peering inside to see the jingle ball, though. Now that she's 15 months old, she's gotten more interested in them. Her favorite thing is to pull the balls apart, but now she can also fit them back together herself - usually the smaller ones. She also likes to kick them like a soccer ball or throw them (outside - on cement) and watch them snap apart. She happily chases after the pieces and puts them back together. Amazingly, they've held together well even with this rough treatment. We also use them to play with in her baby pool.

We got one of the later releases that came with a \"support bar\" - a small plastic bib that resembles a train's cattle guard. This bit is supposed to help the hamster stay upright but it doesn't seem to help that much as our hamsters still fall over all the time.The door to put the hamster into the ball is tricky to operate -- it looks like a real hamster ball's door but isn't nearly as easy to open or shut. Every time we used it, the ball ended up coming apart. Now we don't even bother with the door, we just assemble the ball around the hamster.

I can be done, but a little more effort is needed. It is also hard for a child to understand that you have to squeeze the trigger four times and then a fifth to close the dart shooter.The shield mechanism easily jams if you try to close it by pushing it closed and not using the trigger. It is not easy to fix.

That being said, this is way too small! And it comes apart way too easily. My little guy just took it apart and distributed the pieces all over the house. The connector pieces pop off constantly and the cymbal easily bends, which is hardly good for a baby/toddler toy ( waaaaay too small and fragile for anyone older) My husband was constantly cursing it because he kept finding all the random parts in the couch or unde his feet. I'm sad to have to give a negative review to one of my favorite companies, but this toy is just a waste of money and noneof the kids ever took to it like they do other plan toys, haba and Melissa and Doug toys. it's a shame.", "overall": 2.0}

However, on the Stormtrooper, it just makes him look like a giraffe. The helmet should sit much closer to the figure's torso.

Also, it doesn't matter what piece you use (right or wrong)...as long as it's sitting on top of the open spot it will make the noise.

Overall, I believe he won't get bored with this and my child loves music and making works of art so this goes together well.  I only wish is they made a blue one or more gender neutral color instead of white and purple.", "overall": 4.0}

Further, the surface is coated so normal kid fluids (and those with kids know what I mean) can be easily wiped off.  Lastly, the image is quite cute.

{"text": "FUN BUT NOT DURABLE AT ALL\nThis is a fun plane but not durable at all.  Since there are no landing gear, you essentially have to crash the plane to get it down.  Within the first thirty minutes of using it, we had already broken one propeller during a crash landing.  It comes with two extra propellers but, at this rate, that will get us two more thirty minute play sessions at which point it will be useless (unless extra propellers are available to buy, and buying more for this plane seems a bit ridiculous.)Other issues are that the learning curve to fly is a little steep.  However, once you get the hang of it, it is really fun.  Also, the battery charge does not last long at all.Overall, I just think that the price of this plane is too high considering the lack of durability.  Unless you can figure out how to land this thing perfectly every time, the plane will quickly become unusable.

Instead, each coin simply makes the pig count up one number.So this toy doesn't really teach colors at all. I'd say a (non-electronic) pack of crayons teaches more about colors than this toy.If you lose a coin, the pig won't be able to count to 10 unless you remove and re-insert a coin. besides number counting, the only other features are fluff: an Old MacDonald song that advances a few notes with each coin and a handful of pig related speech when the nose is pressed.On the plus side, this toy has survived a handful of falls from the high chair.", "overall": 2.0}

Luckily, the hoop broke right as things started getting out of control in the fun department and the shock brought us all back to a safe level.All in all, the toy is inexpensive and enjoyable for everyone around a small or probably even large pool. Just realize that there is a certain (low) level of stress this thing can handle before your dreams of taking the gold in the olympic aqua slam dunk championship are shattered.", "overall": 4.0}
{"text": "WHY IMPROVE AN ALREADY CLASSIC DESIGN.\nBeing a sci fi collector, I had to get this toy, considering it is another incarnation of the Enterprise. But I can't understand WHY they had to change the Enterprise so much. I know the movie is supposed to be a reboot of the original show...but then why put Leonard Nimoy in to play Old Spock? If it is a true reboot, leave out the original cast members, and give the ship a totally new design. Yet they stick to the original saucer/tube design. So I am confused. It is a good toy none the less, so if you are a trekie, and like the movie, get it. If you are a die hard original fan...you decide.", "overall": 4.0}

{"text": "WHIMSY PIECES ENGAGE KIDS BUT INCREASE SKILL LEVEL AND REDUCE PORTABILITY\nSummary - \"Whimsy\" pieces complicate the puzzle - good in some ways...Puzzles are great for kids to develop pattern and spatial recognition.  This one turned out to be a little more challenging due to the \"Whimsy\" pieces - pieces that look like chairs, letters, animals, etc.  They reduce the interlocking ability of large sections which means that the puzzle is no longer portable - almost impossible to move.  Also if you bump it, you can easily disconnect the pieces.This means puzzle building with kids can be much more frustrating - on the other hand, they really like the pieces.  I'd recommend getting puzzles with a lower piece count to compensate.Thickness of pieces was pretty standard, resolution of artwork was good.If you have questions, comments or found this review helpful, please let me know!", "overall": 3.0}

I usually don't purchase add on for games but I promise you will not be disappointed. I'm even bringing this to my office (I'm a child therapist) as the \"feelings\" section is excellent for nonverbal or painfully shy children and as a great way to establish rapport in play therapy.

Also they can't move into a flying position, which my daughter found frustrating.It is a nice set though and the details are well done.  Without seeing all the pieces my daughter would ask about some random item (e.g. where's the treasure chest, Peter Pan's dagger, etc.) and it was there.  I don't think she asked for anything that wasn't included.

For example, if you get a Rook card at the beginning, you can't move either of your rooks, so you lose a turn, which makes young players really frustrated amid the confusion.

The strategy just got so stale. Any game that requires you to buy expansion packs within the first 10 plays for it to stay fresh is just not that great of a game.

But if you prefer a game where the outcome can be influenced by something other than luck, Phase 10 is not for you.", "overall": 2.0}
{"text": "BEST FOR SAUSAGE-FINGERED KIDS WHO ENJOY SEIZURES\nI bought these for a birthday party, thinking the colors, textures, and lights would all be a smash hit. To say they weren't would be a vast understatement. The rings themselves are very soft rubbery plastic and the finger hole is far too big for a any finger on even my man-hands, let alone tiny kid fingers. While they initially elicited a \"Cool!\" reaction, the lights are so bright and flash so rapidly that anyone within a half-mile radius will be able to enjoy them and/or immediately suffer from a seizure.

You can play by concentrating on shapes only, on colors only, or on a combination of the two.  The game is fun for kids, and if Brandon is any example, they will like it even if they already have a good grasp of shapes and colors.  Brandon has a younger brother, Joey, who  at 10 months is too young for the game,  but I can see this as a game the two could play together in about a year, with Brandon \"teaching\" Joey all the ins and outs of shapes and colors.

But they don't line up quite well.Light works, and is a bit brighter than I had expected, but not at all a \"flashlight.\"  It's just for show.  The nice thing is that they did a not blatantly obvious switch on the side just a simple \"push on / push off\" that blends with the rest of him, so it isn't some glaring sliding thing sticking out the side.Too bad it didn't have a little speaker and some phrases like the small turrets have.Since there's not a lot of Wheatley options out there, this is about all you can get.

The pieces are also nicely made.  The plastic is smooth with no craggy edges or sharp corners, shaped and weighted to make it all work as it should.  Actually, that is probably one of the best parts of playing this - to have the pieces set up, fall, and clink just right.

Nothing stays together, and instead of bringing my child joy, just frustrates her when she is unable to tug it along.Wheels on Springs - The toy is supposed to be able to switch from pumpkin to carriage on the fly.  The wheels don't stay up very well and instead collapse with very little pressure.Horse? - Wow.  The horse barely even stands up on its own.  The tethers for pulling the carriage don't stay on the horse's saddle.Where's Cinderella? - The whole setup doesn't even include the princess or any characters?  Just a cardboard cutout.

{"text": "FLIMSY, CHEAP, BROKEN IN MINUTES.\nGreat concept. My son loves bugs and robots so what could be better than a robot bug? I've been waiting to buy one for a couple years until I thought he was old enough not to be too rough with it. Ultimately it didn't matter because this thing was broken within about ten minutes of taking it out of the box, and NOT from any rough handling. The bug had walked about two fee before the  pins popped out of the hindmost legs, rendering it immobile; after a little gentle handling to try to see if it could be fixed, the entire rear leg fell off one side. From Christmas stocking to trash can in less than one hour - that has to be a record.I am done with electronic toys. My kids are getting sticks, cardboard boxes, bubble wrap, and dirt as presents from now on. They have more fun will all of those things anyway.", "overall": 1.0}

Needless to say, I can't get this thing away from my husband and now I will have to buy something else for my grandson for Christmas. There should be a disclaimer on the box that no one OVER The age of 18 should be allowed to play this.

{"text": "OVERLY COMPLICATED AND NOT DURABLE\nThough the fun aspect of the toy cannot be disputed; having a helicopter to play with is quite fun, overall I didn't enjoy this toy.  The toy took a long time to charge, and I got only about 3-5 minutes on the charge, not really a lot of time to have fun. AS you begin to learn the complicated controls, it is time for another lengthy charge.I also was unhappy with the durability of the helicopter. Though the controller is heavy and feels like something for a much more expensive toy, the helicopter itself felt flimsy.  After a week or so of playing with it, it began to fall apart, and eventually broke entirely, not able to hold a charge whatsoever.A bit pricy, long to charge, and not durable, these negatives more than overcome the fun aspect of this toy, and i cannot recommend this to my friends.", "overall": 2.0}

I'm happy with it but I can tell the wooden pieces are going to get yucky looking. Also, melissa and doug should include a sturdy top to the box.", "overall": 4.0}

This DVD is aimed at preschoolers but would be great for ages 2 and up (my daughter is 3). It's colorful and entertaining, and contains a wonderful mixtures of Puppets characters and computer animations.In Juno Jr.'s The Day the Music Stopped Bunny presses the big red button on Murphy's Shush Machine, she accidentally silences the town of Harmonia Springs. Juno and her friends realize that in order to bring music back to the town, she and her friends have to create their own music through melody, harmony, rhythm and most importantly friendship.I highly recommend this video, it's engaging, educational and children love it!", "overall": 5.0}

I have this swing and the Little Tikes one (both similar design), and whilst the Little Tikes one seems very stable in terms of keeping the kids upright, this Fisher Price one has tipped my kids upside-down on a few occasions.  When they are swung far back, if happen to lean forward just before they start coming back forward again, this is when it seems to lose balance and leave them suspended head down.  Thankfully the safety straps and the tray table HAVE remained in place to hold them in.  If you do buy this item, I would recommend you make sure it is mounted high enough so that they didn't hit their head if they end up swinging upside down and freaking out.  Supervise.  And follow Fisher Price's caution of having it above a soft surface (eg chipbark or something).", "overall": 2.0}

Like all the other reviewers here, I regret my purchase.A real planetarium projector is completely dark except for a few spots of light projected on the ceiling for the stars.  This device is the opposite - it projects light all over the ceiling, with spots of darkness for the star.  As you can imagine, that ruins the experience.  For just a few cents more, they could have made the sphere dark with pinholes for the stars.  At least this way, it would have made a cool nightlight.The hand-held \"meteor maker\" is just a flashlight with a couple of filters.  Unfortunately, the light is so dim compared to the projector itself, that you can't see the image it projects.I wish I had examined the package more before purchasing it.  I guess it just didn't occur to me that something designed by scientists would be so poorly made.", "overall": 1.0}

I was really excited for her to have this toy but it has turned out to be a waste of money. I was glad that it didn't have batteries, but I would have expected something to engage her besides the waggling tail which she can't get to work. I wish the head would stay up so she could more easily pull it because it basically just topples over unless you can keep the head up and pull (not possible yet for a 6 month- 1 year old). We have had this toy for about 6 months and it's always at the bottom of the toy bin. Even older kids who have come over to play will grab it, play with it for about 30 seconds, and move on.

My kid is 2 and he's able to finish this on his own.If you're considering this puzzle, I would recommend these other Melissa & Doug ones that we've bought on Amazon:- Melissa and Doug Farm Friends Floor Puzzle (It's in the shape of a barn instead of a rectangle).- Melissa & Doug Giant Fire Truck Floor Puzzle (Firetruck shaped and not a boring rectangle).", "overall": 3.0}

However, other than the 'fingerprinting' exercise in the book, she was very disappointed.  The scope is very cheap plastic.  And it does not work either as microscope or telescope.  It is the kind of thing that they sell in the dollar stores or the 5 below type of stores.  Very disappointed girl.  While I do tend to review things that I like, and avoid writing negative reviews because it generally leads me to get negative votes, in this case I must say the truth.  Don't pay a lot for this.

My phone has a pass-code on it, so she can't get much further.The case is annoying for parents because anytime you want to change the app playing or adjust anything you need to completely take the phone out and do it that way.Although I can see the positives of this case, I think an Otterbox is a bit more practical and more likely to keep your phone safe.", "overall": 2.0}

It's not easy to manipulate for little hands - this goes from opening the top to sliding the switch.  I will commend the accessories as being appropriate and entertaining, but since that was the best aspect of toy, we opted to get a less expensive, non-battery activated first purse for our daughter and have been much happier with our choice, less expensive too when bought in store.

{"text": "VERY NICE LEARNING SET, LOOKS TASTY TOO!\nThis is a very nice learning toy!  Not having experience with Learning Resources products I can't compare to other items, but this seems to be of good quality.  My girlfriend thinks it's &#34;adorable&#34; so there is that positive.  As an educator she also thinks it very good for building coordination, sharing, vocabulary, and the mental benefits of pretending.  The kiddo rating is A+! My neice absolutely loves it. Putting the string back in the ketchup and mustard bottles is good for parental coordination and patience building!  The only reason I am giving it 4 stars rather than 5 is that the basket handles do not seem to be of the same quality as the rest of the set. This looks like it could be a failure point in the future, but for now it is holding up great.Get ready to &#34;eat&#34; lots of plastic hamburgers, cupcakes and watermelon...oh, and get set to &#34;refill&#34; the ketchup and mustard often!", "overall": 4.0}

We still have it, and play with it occasionally but truth be told the car that came with it is the most exciting part about it. After maybe 2 weeks of playing with it, and moving it around from shelf to floor, and back, the pieces are always coming apart. And we are always \"fixing\" the track. As  well the track is not as smooth as demos would make you believe. There are some hick ups in the tracks and you have to nudge or shake the track for the car to finish its loops and swirls. Plus the cost of additional cars for this track is not worth the money in our case. Great concept, thrilled our son the morning of xmas, but it just is not a long lasting toy.", "overall": 2.0}

My son took the box out and parts are falling out  from all of the openings on this inside &#34;case.&#34; We had to tape them up. These sets used to come with cases. Second, the instructions are poor. The bolts/screws are so small and sometimes very difficult to assemble. There are several steps that should/can be done beforehand that would make building a lot easier. Second, we're trying to build the first model, a digger, and there's a clear mistake where already set screws prevent the small back platform from fitting!

It comes with 5 different fragrances but my favorite was Jasmine but she didn't like the smell of any of them and when mixing them together,in her opinion they smelled worse. So this was not a hit with her and she got bored very quickly and have yet to create anything since. The set also comes with 2 roller bottles and 8 storage bottles, it would have been better if it also came with some spray bottles.

It is not an easy game to beat, which is good in a coop game.  It is well designed with straightforward rules.  Plus it is hard not to like any game where you battle a large plastic dragon.There are a couple cons to the game.  While players need to work together to battle generals, I think coop games are more fun when there is more interaction.  Shadows Over Camelot is one of the best in this regard.  Also, the layout of the board could be better.  We spend a lot of time looking for locations where we need to move our heroes.

They have a song about a baton so we thought our child would really like using this as a baton and listening to the music it makes... pretending to be a Wiggle. Unfortunately, the toy is poorly designed. I think it would be a better toy if the child's baton movements made music- not sound effects over music already playing. The sound effects aren't really easy to hear over the music the baton is playing and therefore my child loses interest quickly. I'm still not sure my child thinks he's doing anything when he shakes the baton. There are games to make it a more complex toy but they are lost on my 2 1/2 year old and my older children aren't interested. So, this could be a cool toy but, unfortunately, I think the producers missed the mark.", "overall": 3.0}

Possibly my son is too young for this toy, having received it for his first Christmas? Maybe he just simply doesn't like it? However, I can see where it could be a very engaging little toy. Though I haven't tried washing the houses yet, I love the fact that they can go in the washing machine. Having 5 dogs and all the dog hair that goes along with them, having a toy that can be thrown in the washing machine is a dream. My complaint with the toy?

Since the 7 year old is not as proficient at Lego as needed for this building set, he needed a lot of help from Dad to put this together. So that would be the major thing to consider before purchasing this toy. If the child is under 10, he/she will probably need some assistance from someone older, unless they are already very proficient with Lego and Lego type building toys.

That lasted for a few days.  But as that is all they do, they both lost interest (girl,9 and boy, 5) before too long.  Now there are two ants left alive and the rest are little corpses in the sand.

The dough was no fun for my kids and their friends and they immediately lost interest, whereas they can play with Play-Doh for at least an hour before getting bored.I have already thrown away the Moon Dough and we will attempt to squeeze regular Play-Doh through the farm's animal maker.

You will hear that over and over again if you read Ravensburger reviews and that is because they are substantially better than others. I will never buy another puzzle unless it is a Ravensburger.", "overall": 4.0}

Wouldn't purchase this toy for children under 10.  Very labor intensive.4. Some pieces don't fit as they should - more frustration!5. My boys would rather receive Lego kits over this one just for the fact that they can be more creative with less aggravation!My thoughts:1. Looks great.  Durable pieces.2.

It provides no new variants to game play, no extra aspects to consider, no new rules.  It's just more cards.  More items, more monsters, more humor, more cool stuff.BUT... more cards means less card repetition which makes the game more fun and definitely increases the replay value.

That's what my son was trying to do - and of course, it was a bit difficult!  I think we would have enjoyed it more as a chunky puzzle, and the fishing poles just complicated a simple toy.

WHEN IT WORKS.\nA superhero toy that \"launches\" discs, what more could you ask for?!With four adults in the house and the occasional visiting child or two this got a good round about testing phase.The biggest issue was the launching of the discs. No matter who was using it or how they were holding the shield, the discs fired maybe 75% of the time. The other 25% of the time multiple trigger pulls were required or we had to pop the shield open and fiddle with it.During the times it would shoot it was awesome! Outside with a slight breeze you can easily achieve the 20' distance. Without a breeze it can go further.With the price tag that is currently on this shield I would expect it to work almost flawlessly each and every time.So if you have a younger child who is a bit impatient, this will drive them nuts because of it's lack of consistency for launching discs.For the parents and grandparents out there, the shield makes a nice \"hmmmmmmmm\" sound all the time, so be prepared for that annoyance.", "overall": 3.0}

If so, then you're going to be spending hours crouched on your hands and knees figuring out how everything goes together while your kid is telling you to hurry up so he can launch another angry bird.

They do not require any special equipment that you would not be likely to have around the house, though you will need a number of common household items.

Fortunately, we have plenty of Polly Pocket dolls who can visit her, but there's not a whole lot of fun in this pink and purple (and plenty of pastels) world after a week or two.

I've seen some of these in stores selling for almost $60 (not what I paid here obviously), and I just keep thinking that at $60 it would be a complete waste of money.  At $35 it's at least close to reasonable.  Other than those few things, it just doesn't do much.  They keep building these things and they're basically dollhouses for boys.

But (and it's a huge but) we've now had 2 of them, and they've both had the same problem: before 1 set of batteries even wears out, Elmo starts shutting off in the middle of his songs. Elmo also doesn't work properly with the keyboard, a companion toy you can buy...and both will sing the ABC song together...Elmo starts singing in the middle of the ABC song, or he'll move his mouth but no sound comes out. The first time we had a problem, I changed the batteries thinking they could be nearly dead, but the problem didn't improve. So I took back the toy and got a new one. And the same thing happened with Elmo number 2. I may try one more time, but I have a feeling the same thing will happen again.", "overall": 3.0}

The radio-control truck is a good beginner toy for a small child. It has a simple, color-coded system for learning how to drive it. The controller has different colors pointing forward, backward, left, and right, and the car has the same colors on the top of it.The construction site, on the other hand, does not keep my child's attention. It is a very large toy, taking up a lot of space. The pieces come apart pretty easily, and putting it back together is too difficult for a 4-year-old. Since it is so large, it would seem like there should be many functions to play with, but the truck only goes in, up, and out. (And sometimes it gets hung up so it doesn't actually make it all the way up and out.) It just doesn't hold my child's attention or create any imaginative play.So, in summary, the truck's a hit, but the play-set just takes up space.", "overall": 2.0}

{"text": "I DON'T GET IT.\nSo, its a Samurai sportscar that will somehow exist alongside dinosaur robots?  Makes sense.As far as an actual toy, $16.99 seems pretty high for what you actually get here.  It's a fairly small car (5&#34; long or so), with a fairly bland detail/design when in Bugatti form.  The actual transforming isn't too tough, but I did need the instructions.  Even when I did get it into car mode, it wasn't quite a snug fit, so the car kinda popped open in half just 1/16&#34; of an inch.  Either way, it didn't snap into a nice solid car shape.Drift comes with two short swords and two long swords.  The short swords fit nicely inside the cab of the car when in Bugatti mode, but the long swords just snap to the bottom of the car.  It wouldn't be an issue, but because the car doesn't 'snap' into car mode, the swords sag just a bit on the bottom and drag on the ground.  As such, the car doesn't roll nicely (or at all).  Feels a liiiiiiiittle bit like a cheap design, but with a full-blown licensed price tag.", "overall": 3.0}

It really feels like you get everything you need to play without having to buy extra figures or vehicles. I was also surprised by the size. For some reason, I expected it to be much smaller.

This card game, however, is a different story.  I still don't get the questions right but I can steal cards from my opponent who does get the questions right and I can use a wild to get credit for a particularly difficult subject by answering a subject that is easier for me.  With the elimination of all the dice rolling the game proceeds much more quickly making the prospect of playing an entire game less daunting.

The game can take a very long time to progress, and for the last half hour we were playing, all of the women were simply checking their phones waiting for it to be over.

This is useless for a child that still needs some help balancing as he/she begins to learn how to walk since as soon as the kid puts any weight on it, it shoots forward.

This mechanism is frustrating for younger children and even for adults! It resulted in ours ceasing to function after a few weeks' play. The only other criticism is that it takes three button cells, which are difficult to insert and costly to replace. I can't help but think that AAA cells would have done the same job easier.All in all, a good replica, but the Sonic Screwdriver is much better as a toy.", "overall": 3.0}

Ironing may take care of that, but if we store the puzzle mat back in the original box between puzzles, it would be the same problem each time.

That is not the case; instead, the contents of the \"blender\" need to be poured out from the blender itself into a cup.

While the idea is fun, it grew old quickly.  Unlike the original Bop it, with the change from pulling, twisting and bopping, which was fun and kept the kids in their toes, Bop it Smash relies on your quick reflexes (and learning where the lights need to be when you smash) and with no change in game play, the kids easily tired of the toy and have not gone back to it.", "overall": 3.0}

When my daughter tried to fill the bathtub with water, everything inside got wet and stickers started to peel off. With the loss of the shower unit, the van became less attractive to be used with water, and this way the stickers, which by the way are way to many, stay on.

The image used in this particular puzzle is of a bright yellow new york taxi cab against a greyscale manhatten backdrop. Once complete the picture looks nice unfortunately trying to complete it, with the sheer amount of bland greyscale makes it fairly difficult, especially the areas of sky between the buildings.Overall its a decent puzzle and should keep you entertained for a while if you like jigsaw puzzles but this isn't one of the best Ravensburger has produced and I would suggesting looking at other puzzles in their catalog before buying this one.", "overall": 3.0}

Whenver other kids visit our house, this is still one of the most-played-with toys.  And, our 2-y.o. son is just getting started playing with them.

Everything falls over or is too hard for her to open or turn on her own. I'm glad the price of this at least has come down.

Very good, high quality puzzle.The pieces are of high quality and should last through multiple put-togethers. Nice matte finish on the image. The one problem with the puzzle is that the pieces come apart very easily (which ensures that the puzzle will last longer), so if you put some of the puzzle together in one spot and some other parts of the puzzle in another, it's difficult to transfer.

The balls shoot hard and quite a distance so some safety precautions are required. Otherwise things can get out of hand pretty quickly. Keep the pets away.

Bill threw a piece of bread at a Canadian goose and it reminded me of when he threw the die at my chin. It caused me to kick Bill in the groin.

Once she turned one, I set this up in the yard. She can't quite climb the stairs without me guiding her feet since these stairs just go straight up and are unable stairs in a house. She also would rather climb up the slide instead of going down. So for now, she just hangs out in the house part for a little bit -- as you can see in the video. I think this would be better for kids closer to 18 months. For now, I'm thinking about removing the slide, ladder & legs and just use this as a ground-level fort/playhouse. So far, I'm only able to get the slide & ladder off but the legs don't seem to wanna come undone!", "overall": 4.0}

Both my 6 and 7 year old like to fly her around, crank the wings down, and then let them flip up.  But they loose interest in the doll relatively quickly.  The arms have to be up for the wings to fold down or come up and she looks funny always being in that position.  Neither of the girls had a problem cranking them down like other reviewers though.

I'm really glad that the back of the truck locks or snaps in rather firmly and no matter how fast he runs pushing it.... it never flips up on him. If you have the giant bag of megablocks the excess does not fit in the truck... but we were able to add in quite a bit more for higher building. Its a huge hit in the house and I'm so glad.

It is a load of fun; the cars make realistic crashing sounds when they bump into things and go flying around the track and off of ramps in a way that is loads of fun.  Since the previous owners played with it for (I think)at least a year or two before we got it, and it's still working for us a year or so into our use of it, I would rate its durability quite high.  But the track does sort of shift out of place from time to time, and it can be sort of a pain to put together, though it's not that hard once you get the hang of it.) So we love playing with it, but at $160+, I think it is overpriced.", "overall": 4.0}

{"text": "FUN FOR SMALL CHILDREN...  PRETTY ANNOYING FOR PARENTS...\nI have two main complaints with this toy:1) Although it's a drum, a child can't actually beat on it and get the desired 'drumming' effect.  Every time you move it you set off a musical feature, which is fine but not what I'd expected.2) There are three specific settings on this drum for three different songs.  So, if you set it to option A (for example), then you're stuck listening only to song A until you flip a switch.  This makes for a REALLY annoying toy for parents.  I think it would be much better if the manufacturer had at least put these three songs into some kind of loop!Overall though, my daughter seems to enjoy this.  She's 9 months old, so it's small enough that she can lift it herself and beat on it easily.  She enjoys the light features that are built in and she's too young to realize that the COMPLETELY repetitive nature of this toy is appalling!", "overall": 3.0}

All the accessories get played with once then disperse around the house, separated from the set and eventually get lost. The blades to this helicopter do spin but you have to make them spin.

My 3 y.o. likes to hear the songs, but she already knows her colors and body parts.  She'll listen to it for a few minutes longer, then it just goes back in the box with the stuffed animals.There is one thing that is rather annoying, there's no internal on/off button.  So the puppy can't be held purely as a stuffed animal (ie, at night when the child is sleeping), because, if your child touches the button on the foot it is easily turned back on.

In that short amount of time my greatest frustration has been with the legs of the table. They are made to fold underneath the table for transportation and storage. Unfortunately it's not sturdy enough to be beneficial. As much as you try to avoid it, kids have a tendency to climb on tables, especially toddlers. The legs of the table aren't made for this kind of abuse and I honestly wish they simply snapped on and off like the Fisher Price Laugh and Learn Table. However, they do like the table, and have a great deal of fun with it.

Your hand number each round doubles as that round's wild card number in addition to the Jokers.That said, if you like strategy and resource management, you will never find them here. It is good for children but adults would do best starting on round 7 or so, because it is lots of arranging sets and runs until it is your turn to draw a card or grab an old one hoping the last player dropped a good card you need.I recommend any other game over this one, starting with Fluxx, which at least has rules changes to keep interest going.", "overall": 2.0}

As well, each time someone hits your ship, you need to remove one of your tight lego type pieces and replace it with a \"hit\" cone.  The UBuild pieces are tight and therefore, you need to pick up your ship and try to get your fingernails under the piece to remove it.

Personally, I think the scenarios somewhat simplistic and combine them, but they are all fun by themselves as well. A novel aspect to Settlers of Catan once you've tired of the original game play, \"Traders and Barbarians\" allows new strategies and pieces. However, the actual amount of new pieces is minimal (with only a few new resource tiles), and I wish I could've gotten a little bit more for the amount of money I spent.

It comes with both black and white paper, which was mostly used up on Christmas morning.  It comes with 5 paint tubes and two vials of glitter.  While the paint looks great on the black paper when first applied, it practically disappears after it dries.

The game doesn't go together or come apart very easily, nor without fear it will break. It also requires to be disassembled every time you play because it won't fit back into the box otherwise. Even after you take it apart, it fits very poorly into the box and you have to somewhat carefully arrange the pieces in order for it to go back inside. The box itself is falling apart after only 4 plays of the game. I'd ditch the box altogether if it came with something to keep the little plastic balls in, but of course it doesn't, and the game when assembled is awkwardly shaped, so it doesn't fit well onto shelving or inside cabinets.

The camera was easy to use, but the pictures all turned out dark.  You could barely see us in some of them.  There are a lot of games, books and videos to download that ranged from $2.99 to almost $20, though it seemed like the average was around $7.99.Overall, my 7 year old didn't seem too impressed.  Sometimes he plays with this, but he seems to gravitate to my Nook tablet more, not sure if it's the size or just the type of games.

{"text": "VERY DIFFICULT TO PLAY... I WOULD CHOOSE A DIFFERENT GAME.\nThis was purchased for my kids last year and sent to Goodwill this year.Cons:The game itself sounds fun. The problem is the frogs don't fly or land with any predictability. Sometimes they fly perfect and fall off the tree, other times they fly in random directions.The frogs need to be reached for to reclaim to have more chances, which is hard too do during the game.After both kids 3 & 6 years old at the time lost interest due to frustration. We tried a few more times over the course of the year and decided to donate it.Pros:Idea of flipping frogs on a treeSound effects are funnyTree flipping up and throwing frogs off is a twist.", "overall": 2.0}

She did at first and giggled and giggled when she easily maneuvered it with the clever wheel-shaped remote control. But once the novelty wore off, she was right back on her bed, playing with her dolls. :-)Kid Galaxy My 1st RC GoGo Auto Jumbo Fire Truckis made of some kind of soft plastic that's softer like rubber, so it's perfectly safe for the little ones. I also like it because it seems durable and is her very first remote control toy. Learning to handle a remote control is good practive for when she comes of age for more techie products.Yes, she still goes back to it during playtimes, so it is not neglected...

{"text": "DECENT VALUE BUT NOT WELL BALANCED.\nThese are about what we expected. You get a lot of letters (and numbers) for the money so it's a decent value. However we found that some of the capital letters do not stay straight when placed on a metal surface. Upon examination this is due to the very small sixed single magnet not being well balanced on the letter. The magnet is not strong enough to hold the letter upright so it tends to turn onto its side. This can be solved by having the letters touch each other as you place them into works. Using this method the letters hold each other straight. So far I've only notice some of the capital letters doing this. The lower case letters seem ok.Also be careful with the seller.

While this figure has more range of motion than the original, you would not want to extend it to its limits because the gaps that are created are so ugly.  The thickness of the material has been reduced from the original and I believe that is part of the problem.

The scooper works great, although the treats and poop are small so careful in giving this toy to a 3 year old, the box says 3 years and up but in my opinion it should be 6 years and up to do the many small choking parts. The dog is of good quality. U press the head to make the mouth open, the ears move too. The eyes close when it eats. The dogs legs are not movable, I wish they were. Great set overall and glad I got it. UPDATE: the dog treats get stuck inside the head when u flip it over or falls in the ground. It's stuck in there, this is the second time this has happened. Do not leave the treats inside or you will have a very upset child and empty wallet.  They go up to the head and some how get lodged inside.", "overall": 1.0}

For one thing, it doesn't go very fast. It is very slow moving, which is probably why it doesn't bounce back and flip the way it's shown on TV. It gets stuck easily and doesn't ride over things well. If my sons get the car anywhere behind them, it won't go because it seems that they have to be right behind the car for the remote to make it work, so if the car is behind them, it no longer is in range. I was pretty excited about getting this because all the other remote cars my kids have had end up being 'outside' toys because they mark up our walls and baseboards too much.

You basically pick a character ranging from a fighter, rogue, mage & cleric, each class has an amount of gold needed to win the game, so the rogue needs 10,000 gold but is fairly weak so it would be hard for him to fight higher level monsters which drop better gold, unlike the mage who needs 30,000 gold to win the game but it better at fighting higher level monsters.

We haven't had any trouble with pegs - or entire ships - falling out.Positive: The game board is much more colorful and attractive. The letters are accompanied by the NATO Phonetic Alphabet, so our kids have to shout out, \"E, Echo 7\" or \"F, Foxtrot 9\" on their turn.Negative: The game board design requires a more delicate hand as there isn't much weight in the legs, so it is easy to push the entire game around as you insert pegs.In summary, this is still a fun game.

It also plays notes, if she wants to make her own music.  The downside is that there is no volume knob.  But I solve that by putting a piece of duct tape over a portion of the speaker (useful on infant toys as well).  This mutes the sound a bit and lets us all listen without blowing our ears off.A great toy for the younger Wiggles fans.  Takes a licking and keeps on ... singing.", "overall": 4.0}

We put everything together, I showed him how to use it, and off we went.Shooting the marbles at the blocks, and knocking them through. A couple of reload timeouts and my bomber broke.

First, the frying pan and pot are very shallow so if you put any toy foods in, you can't even stir them around with the spatula or spoon that come with the set. Second, when you try to rest the spatula or spoon inside the pot or pan, they fall out because of the shallowness. Also the silverware is larger than the plates.

{"text": "I REALLY WANTED TO LIKE IT, BUT IT IT IS HARD FOR LITTLE KIDS TO PUT TOGETHER\nThis it the type of toy that looks great for 2-4 year olds to work on spatial perception, cause/effect, etc.You can set the gears in several configurations to figure out which parts will move or not. With this specific set you can't build a lot of different contraptions, but you can set gears in different spatial configurations.Conceptually, this seems great for young kids, but something that is somewhat limited for older kids. The pieces are durable and of high quality. The problem is that the pieces fit too tight, so it is really hard (nearly impossible) for little hands to do the assembling and manipulation. If the adult needs to put together the toy, and then help the child move the pieces then, in my opinion,  the value of the toy goes away. Now, if they could only modify the pieces slightly so little kids could actually play with them (instead of just looking) this would be a wonderful toy.", "overall": 3.0}

With a new baby coming into the family, I wanted tools that would be safe in the hands of a two year old with an infant in the home. No batteries are needed. The drill makes a clicking sound. The rubber is soft but sturdy on all the pieces. The tools & toolbox are durable & not easily broken. I high recommend this toolset.", "overall": 5.0}
{"text": "VERY DISAPPOINTED\nI was so excited when I bought this the other day for my almost 2 year old because she loves bubble. It was really easy to put together, but that was the only thing that was good about it. No matter how hard we pushed, it was really hard to actually get any bubbles to come out.  I followed the directions of pushing for about 15 feet but it still did not work properly.  I think I wasted almost a whole container of bubble solution (eventhough I know it is really cheap) just trying to get any bubbles to come out. My little one now just pushes it around the lawn or back yard pretending to cut grass.  So at least it is useful if there aren't any bubbles.", "overall": 2.0}

All the other DC Direct figures look like they could be living in the same universe, but this one doesn't look like it's the same species as the other ones. The head is small and thin compared to any of the other figures and it just looks out of place when displayed next to them.Overall I'd say that this is still a great figure and I recommend it, because it looks and moves incredibly when taken by its own merits.", "overall": 4.0}

However, it is not overly durable if you use it as an outdoor toy.  The stickers that come with the playhouse quickly peeled off within a few months of play.  This was disappointing, because they really added to the decor of the playhouse.  The plastic shutters ended up cracking and one shutter fell off...plus the color of the shutters turned very yellow and foggy over time.  The basketball netting also did not last and frayed very quickly.  My children (3 & 5) loved the store side of the house, and would hand out food to mom and dad all day long.  They also enjoyed using the gasoline pump to fuel their bicycles and john deere tractors.  The creativity of the toy is fun, but I would recommend keeping this indoors to maintain the appearance of the playhouse.

Machine twisting was done by one child who had two strands of extensions.  The other girls just braided theirs.  They liked the clips, but there weren&#8217;t enough to go around, and there&#8217;s only one headband.I supposed there&#8217;s enough in the kit if a child wanted to play by herself, but a girl can only make two twisted braids before needing to undo it and make something else.

Once the Queen is places, players can also move the tiles already on the board.  Each of the tiles has special movement abilities.  Some are more defensive, and some are more offensive.This version gets particular praise, because it includes some errata and clarification in the rules, it includes the two optional pieces that came out since the original game was published, and it is truly portable.Five stars!I highly recommend this game!In service,Rich", "overall": 5.0}

The rubber bands that come with this seem to be thin and break easily. It's frustrating for my daughter to complete a bracelet and start carefully take it off of the loom and have rubber bands break. She then has to take everything apart and start all over. She's careful with it too.At the time of placing this order I wasn't all that familiar with these bracelet making kits. I've done more research and ordered her one straight from the name brands website. It was affordable and shipping was under $1.50. Can't beat that!!Ahh well so this wasn't a hit. Lesson learned.

I needed to take some string, and attach it to the existing cord to extend the pen so it could be used with the left hand.

Also there are only five colors included, with three being similar (tan, yellow, brown).  Still, that is enough to make pretty pictures.What Crayola calls \"glitter paper\" is paper with foil patterns that do not fall off or make a mess.  That's great!  Also, there is a subtle glitter to the parts of the paper than can be drawn on.  The pages do not tear out easily, but there is a large margin to allow for cutting them out with scissors.

They're marketed as being able to be thrown as a ball, kicked, etc. They don't stay connected well enough for that type of play.

She spent the first couple days just touching the pictures - getting them to make sounds or say little phrases.  Then she started using the pen to actually \"read\" the words and play some games.

However, we sent it back within a few days because neither child was interested. It only does a couple of things, and is pretty boring. We usually try not to have to many electronic toys around the house, both so our kids develop their imaginations, but also so that in the event that we would like them to sit a while with one, they are actually interested in it (retaining the novelty factor). This didn't even grab their interest initially. Many toys captivate them to start with and then in three days, they are bored with it, but this was never even a starter. Disappointing from Fisher Price, as they usually are pretty reliable at what they make.

{"text": "FUN GAME, TOUGH TO STORE\nI played with game with my 5 and 6 year old daughters and was able to teach them the rules fairly easily. It takes a bit of reading so I wouldn't recommend it for children who don't read unless you will be playing with them. The game is only for two players so my wife and I play two teams with our daughters. My daughters love playing the game and have picked up the strategy pretty well. The only negative I have with the game is the packaging. It makes it stand out on a store shelf, but getting all the pieces put back in the strangely shaped packaging and storing it as you bought it is very difficult. Good luck getting your kids to put it away neatly. I would suggest getting a different box to store the game in. Maybe a small shoebox would work. That small negative would not prevent me from recommending this game to others. The fact that it is only for two players limits it's appeal, but it is a fun game that can be played multiple times without becoming dull.", "overall": 4.0}

The reason I gave this toy 4 stars is the bag is really lacking. Everything INSIDE the bag is well made and is definitely worth the money. However, the bag itself is hard to open and close and is also kind of small for everything to go in. I wish that the bag was as well made as the actual doctor tools otherwise this is a FANTASTIC TOY.

This one is about 6 inches in diameter.  I can see some educational value in helping children understand the curved pieces and such.  I think where this falls flat for me was getting the zodiac one.  This would have much more educational value if they were planets, the moon, or other celestrial models.  I should have gotten one of them.  Still, I can see where these could become addicting and you end up buying every one in the set.  The quality is very good.

Initially, I was perplexed that it didn't include dirt or seeds, but that also allows kids to decide which projects they'd like to undertake. You'll need to provide dirt, seeds, water, and patience to watch things grow. Because the jar and pots are clear, you can see the  root systems develop to watch what&#8217;s happening above and below the dirt.

The music is cheery and delightful but it stops every 15-20 seconds to say \"catch me baby\" or \"almost, keep going\" things that are positive and should encourage baby to crawl and drive the parents up the wall. I do turn it on quite frequently for my son but this isn't something we leave on for too long due to it's chatty nature, if it were simply musical I would like it a lot more. I like that baby can 'catch' it and stop it from moving, it is a little game my boy likes to play, but sometimes the toy does not register that he has caught it and it proceeds to flee from my child.", "overall": 3.0}

The first person to complete a face wins!The face pieces are fun and goofy and highly amusing to all of us and it is a fun game.The problem is with the durability.  After playing it once or twice none of the colorform pieces will stick to the faces anymore. They all curl up and fall off.  This is frustrating to me and incredibly frustrating to my three year old.  We can clean them off and flatten them and then they work for a little bit again.The spinner is also poor quality, it gets stuck a lot and is in general hard to spin.

If your monster dies you will be eliminated from the game but games are short and if I get knocked out I don't mind watching the others because it won't be long before a new game is started.

The figure (which serves as the game cartridge) doesn't slip easily into place and the door which shuts to begin the game easily jams.  Connecting to the TV isn't as easy as you might hope and when it connects, the color resolution on the games is poor.As for the games themselves, I can only comment on the included Optimus Prime games.  They are all pretty basic running and dodging games and the graphics might be retro if my four year old had strong memories of 80s video games.

You can mix and match the fairy wings, tierras, skirt, mermaid fin, shoes, muffs etc. There are 2 slightly different colored blonds and one light brown haired dolls. This is a fun and Enchanting set of dolls. I have books and toys for when the kids come to visit this set will go into the toy box.

Things can easily get moved around if the children aren't careful and with a 5+ recommend the younger kids are going to knock things around.The point of the game is to move from the basement to the attic. You look for items along the way, rolling the dice to move. The first player that makes it to the attic wins. Any time you play you can get sent back down to the bottom, so it can get a little exciting. I love the fact that you can change things up, move the rooms, etc, so things don't get boring. I do recommend this game for kids 5+ - just know that you might have some issues when the game is bumped around.

My son was a little hard on it, but not any more rough than he is with all of his other toys, which are still intact. Accidently dropping it on the kitchen floor was probably the worst thing that happened to it. We've only had the second Buzz for three months and it has begun, his left foot has broken off and my son is so sad. He was not rough at all with the second Buzz and it still broke so easily.

When I see her fully engaged and interacting with this toy; it makes me very happy as well. Snow White and Cinderella figurines are included with the castle, and other figurines are available for separate purchase. One of the best things about this toy, is that it's interactive. A child will have a wonderful time saying the name of the character, repeating a phrase and singing the lyrics to a song. This is imagination at its best.

So, with any handling or movement, the baby starts cooing, giggling, etc. And the sound are very realistic, lifelike, and clear. So if you're gift wrapping this, make sure to turn the switch on her back to OFF.The \"coolness\" factor is pretty high: the noises are cute, the bouncing up & down is fun. Not sure the longevity of the coolness factor, though. A kid could potentially get tired of her tricks quickly. Construction is average, molded plastic/resin/whatever, including the hair. The hair is actually quite hard, and would hurt if the doll was flung and hit someone. The huge, sparkly eyes could get creepy (ah, for the long lost days when dolls' eyes closed).The \"education\" is low -- the electronic-ness, I feel, stifles a bit of the creativity a child naturally has.

At first my husband and I were concerned that it was to \"old\" for her, but we put it on the fridge anyway just to see how it went. Good thing we did, our daughter LOVES playing with it while we are in the kitchen and anytime she can get to it. She loves hearing the sounds of the letters and the ABC song. She quickly learned how to put the magnets in the main magnet to make it work. Although, she is not familiar with her letters, I believe this is a great early start to her learning of them. We are going to a birthday party this weekend and our daughter will be giving the birthday boy the Leap Frog Fridge Phonics Set.

{"text": "MUNO'S EYEBALL PAINT WEARING OFF AFTER ONLY A DAY'S PLAY\nVery disappointed in the quality. Poor Muno is loosing the black of his eye and its only been a day since my 2 year old started playing with it. The reason I bought this over Ty products is that the tag says that its for 2+ years whereas for Ty its 3+. I have now already placed my order with Ty and am going to return this one. Sorry, bad product.", "overall": 2.0}
{"text": "SHAMEFUL EXECUTION OF A CUTE IDEA\nThis castle comes in a box that advertises an adorable play castle that I imagined my daughter enjoying.  The reality check began when I opened the box to find a plethora of little pieces that I was expected to put together myself with some vague instructions.  In the end,  I found that this was one of those kinds of toys that as my daughter plays with it, a piece pops off every twenty minutes or so.  It started with Clover's window seat.  That was easy enough to put back in to place.  Then the stair railing came off.  Next, it was the window screen and pieces of the roof.  This toy was cute at first, when it was all put together, but It was easy to see that it was too fragile to actually play with.  Save your money for something else!  This toy is not his but a frustration.", "overall": 2.0}
{"text": "GREAT\nLike the 9000 expansion, this set comes with Victory Point tokens. Wish it had D20s. The box can be trashed and the cards stored in the Base box, but if they do a new set it will hopefully be in a redesigned box that can hold twice as many decks of Smash Up (and a slot for scoring dice maybe?).Some reviews seem to dislike the Madness Deck, but my biggest problem was that deck should have a red back to differentiate it from the Army decks.Out of the decks, I wish Cthulhu, Gug, some of the other HPL critters weren't prevalent.I really disliked the Innsmouth deck, as the creatures are all the same level 2 minion. The deck has a couple \"Power 2 minions are +1 this turn only\" cards, but their weak power seemed to get them crushed. I feel the power boost should be permanent or at least give the Locals (the Innsmouth minion) +1 no matter what. I may need to play a few more games with them, but as is, I was crushed hard playing them.", "overall": 4.0}

{"text": "BAD\nThis toy is terrible...Received it as a gift for my daughter, and I didn't even know it was supposed to be magnetic, not to mention the pieces do not fit properly. My daughter also stepped on the box and got a nasty cut from it so be careful. I would advise on getting a different brand. Not good.", "overall": 1.0}

I saw them on Amazon's deals of the day and bought one.  We've got these sticking on the glass front door.  They do take a while to dry before you can use them (4 to 6 hours), but she'll make a sheet worth of stickers and then go play with something else.  Great price, and I will be buying these for my daughters' friends' birthdays!", "overall": 5.0}
{"text": "REALLY COOL\nThis product did exactly what it was supposed to. I had no problems with it. I had it balancing on nearly everything. The paint on it is very cheap. Falls off right in your hand. I don't mind that much. It's definitely not made for children under 10. My nephew managed to break it within seconds. It took a while to put the pieces back together.", "overall": 4.0}

{"text": "WASTE OF MONEY (EVEN THOUGH ITS CHEAP)\nSave your money, buy a Wii.  This doesn't compare in the least and is actually harder for the kids to control than a Wii.  The motion controller is hard to work, the games are dull even for my 3 year old and the graphics are beyond bad.  I thought there was something wrong with our tv when we started using it.  The kids have probably used it 3-4 times since Christmas even though it is set up and available to use at any time and they lose interest in less than 10 minutes.

{"text": "NICE LOOKING BUT DOESN'T WORK\nThe chopper is nice looking and probably can last several blast into the wall or straight down on the concrete ground since it's made mostly with soft plastic.  However, it would be great if it actually flies.  I bought two of these, packages arrived non-damaged, choppers charged as instructed, turned on, one flapped and spun on the floor, and the other one blinking LEDs in silence.  Had to explain to the kids that these choppers didn't work, and watched them sobbing in disappointment.  Overall, don't waste your money.  If I bought only one and it didn't work, ok, my poor luck.  If I bought two different models from the same company and neither worked, poor quality.", "overall": 1.0}

{"text": "WOULD BE FIVE STARS IF IT DIDN'T SHUT OFF AFTER 20 SECONDS\nThis toy is the right size and lots of fun for my seven month old grandson to play with; however, he loses interest very quickly when the toy turns off after 20 seconds.  I don't understand why the manufacturer chose such a short window for a young child.  Sometimes, the child wants to turn it over and explore and by the time they turn it back over, it is turned off and they don't have the dexterity or the thought process to turn it back on.I like the concept but not the execution.  I would not recommend this for six months.  I would think 12 months and up might be more appropriate.", "overall": 3.0}
