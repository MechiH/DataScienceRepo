So much more than a House of Character \u2013 this is a home. Offering a perfect layout of Courtyard, plenty room for dining and entertaining; while the property itself is wrapped around with all windows and doors looking in or over. What we loved absolutely about this property is the use of real wood throughout. The floors are authentic solid wood parquet, while the kitchen is handmade using Tulip and Olive wood; a triumph of craftsmanship. This wood theme continues up in the master bedroom, where the ceiling is certainly a statement piece. Entry into this (in parts) 500-year-old home, is via a small cobbled alleyway, you have 2 or 3 neighbours; a welcoming entrance hallway is spacious with further double doors opening to the courtyard, guest w.c. A further reception room, wine room, fitted kitchen with all appliances, and living and dining room complete the entrance level. The splendid courtyard \u2013 ( a stunning private setting) is approximately 42 sqm and offer abundant planting and climbers, and ample seating and dining opportunities. Heading up to the first floor (stairs from the kitchen) Opens into, what could be a further family room, leads to possible bedroom 4? or you may prefer a study? This room leads to a small hallway, 2 double bedrooms, a laundry room and family bathroom. The laundry room has a conservatory attached and opens onto the roof space. We have not forgotten about the master bedroom suite \u2013 we felt this deserved an introduction of its own: Leading from the family room at the top of the stairs, the suite opens into a dressing room, (bedroom 5?) and through to a mezzanine master bedroom with luxury bathroom en-suite. The master bedroom, we can reveal; was what enticed the current owner to buy this property, and when you see the setting \u2013 you may concur. With a fireplace nook, a balcony opening over the courtyard, and the \u2018slipper bath\u2019 this truly is a luxury peaceful space. Popping back downstairs, we have to mention the garage; what a bonus to have such a space in the church core setting. This is not any garage \u2013 with a double width automatic door, the initial space will easily accommodate 1 or 2 cars, while there is an additional 2-3 car space. It does not end there \u2013 a further 2-3 car space is currently used as a store room and could be office etc. This space alone is the size of a small apartment. Let\u2019s get to the practicalities of this House of Character Naxxar: This beautiful home has been preserved, upgraded and modernised to the highest standards. A previous owner was a master carpenter, we applaud him, while the current owner has renewed all the electrics, plumbing, drains and bathrooms. There is a well with all the mechanics in place to feed tanks. We all know the issue of Houses Of Character here in Malta \u2013 shedding. However, this home with superior aged stone has been left alone as it should be and presents none of these common issues. The property is freehold.

Behind the kitchen is the oldest part of the property, dating back centuries. This consists of 3 seperate rooms that can be a family room, study, t.v. room perhaps? On this floor you will also find allocated, a guest w.c. The stairs, from the kitchen, lead to 2 Bedrooms, with ceiling heights of over 3 meters high, the master bedroom has a seperate dressing area \u2013 that could be an en-suite? This dressing area also has a mezzanine floor. The plan is for a family bathroom that is access \u2018Jack and Jill\u2019 style from both bedrooms. From this floor you will be able to access the roof terrace; that sits over the kitchen, and looks down onto the courtyard. The \u2018Remissa\u2019 entrance: This deserves some explanation on its own. With a double gate entrance into effectively a long external hallway, this \u2018Remissa\u2019 has built on top 2 rooms that could be converted into a flatlet. This is seperate to the main house and looks over the courtyard from the front entrance.

A staircase would have to be constructed to access this from the ground floor entrance. This is an interested property; not least as it is in a lovely location in the heart of the Village. There is great parking meters away, you would not be able to bring a car into the property, but a scooter would work no problem. The rear ground floor rooms are wonderful and the stonework is a piece of art, and if you love these old properties \u2013 this is certainly worth a look. What we would say is that the oldest part (the rear 3 rooms) is a lower ceiling height that we are perhaps used to \u2013 however; this should be easily solved with some minor excavation to provide that height, if required.
