During the early 17th century, Grand Master Antoine de Paule of the Order of St. John commissioned the building of another fully detached bungalow featuring a high walled garden in close proximity to his residence, the Palace of San Antonio. Legend has it, that this estate was entered by crossing a short footbridge from this very garden spanning from the main Palace. A secret underground tunnel was also discovered which served as an emergency escape route for the Grand Master. Therefore, this one of kind property may have ultimately played a role in the protection of the grand master De Paule. This villa has also survived two world wars and has remained practically unchanged with only some minor modification and art deco styling. It is presumed that the garden has also kept most of its original features. In fact, an extremely old Norfolk Island Pine stands as the centre piece of the protected garden reflecting the ages gone by. The first ever recorded wedding reception held at the Villa took place in 1944. Today, the villa and its glorious history proudly offer the style and charm for an elegant wedding and special events venue. The estate covers 2000 sqm and is fully licensed for commercial purposes.", "details": {"Size": "500sqm", "Bathrooms": "2"}, "features": []}
