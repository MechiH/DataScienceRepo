Although they are well-made and apparently durable, they are not compatible with my Keurig B70 Platinum Series Brewer.The Ekobrew cup, when placed in either of the only two possible (180 degree rotatory) configurations, prevents the unit from latching closed.  This appears to be caused by the hinge on the Ekobrew cup which is not flush with its own lid (i.e. hinge sticks up higher than lid of reusable k-cup, thus preventing brewers lid to latch closed).Please note that this brewer is NOT one the models with which the Ekobrew cup is listed as incompatible.  Perhaps this is the case for other models, too, but I am only speculating on that.I've read two other reviews, ZoeGirl on November 9, 2012 and Romy on November 10, 2012, with the same complaint of nonclosure of the brewer with the cup in place.Even more disappointing is the fact that this item is amongst those few with a , \"no return,\" policy.

{"reviewText": "Since the moment I saw this tea, I was intrigued by it.  On the one hand, it looked like a really interesting new tea concept (I'm an avid tea drinker and have had a wide variety of unusual teas, plus I make my own homemade blends), but on the other hand, I worried that it would be disgusting and unpleasant, like drinking the water you boiled your veggies in.  For that reason, I held off on trying it, but now I've finally decided to give it a go.  So, I tested all the flavors, following the directions exactly.  The directions state that you have to use 10 oz. of water, which I did, and I'd have to say that's about right to fill a reasonable sized mug.  I steeped them the full 10 minutes at first, then after they came out really weak, I increased it to 20 minutes to try to get a stronger flavor.  Let's break this down by flavor-Carrot Curry:  I went for this flavor first; no particular reason.  Since this is a vegetable tea, I opted not to sweeten it.  I sniffed the tea bag before I brewed it, and I'd have to say it definitely smells strongly of curry, with carrot undertones.  Not unpleasant at all.  I steeped it the 10 minutes that was recommended, and it tasted very weak.  It was very bland and only the vague curry spices came through, although those were weak too.  Then I decided to let it steep for 20 minutes to try to get a stronger flavor.  It only improved slightly.  As for the taste, it tasted of very very weak carrot and more strongly of curry spices.  It kind of tasted like you boiled some water with a sprinkling of curry powder mixed into it.  In fact, you could probably get the same effect doing just that, but add in your own carrot juice to make it even better!Beet Cabbage:  The smell of this one turned me off immediately.  It just smells kind of unpleasant, but I suppose I should've expected that from something called \"beet cabbage\" which honestly doesn't sound appealing as a tea at all.  Still, I tried it.  My conclusion is that the beet flavor is very weak, letting the cabbage flavor come out too much.  I didn't much like this one, and I think if the beet flavor had been much stronger, it would've tasted better.Broccoli Cilantro:  Immediately, the smell of this tea bag just hits you in the face with cilantro.  It's not terrible, and I suppose it's better than smelling like broccoli, but it kind of put me off at first.  Then I brewed it, and the smell didn't significantly change.  The taste was interesting...  It was very heavy on the cilantro, but the broccoli came out a bit too.  The flavor reminded me of the broth to a vegetable soup.  It probably wouldn't be too bad if it had been a broth base for a soup, but as a drink, I can't say I care much for it.Fennel Spice:  The tea bag for this one smelled quite nice, and smelled very similar to a spiced anise tea blend that I make for myself (1 part anise seeds, 1 part fennel seeds, 1 part cinnamon, 1 part vanilla bean, 1 part cloves-  try it; it tastes like licorice!).  For this reason, I thought I might like this one a lot.  However, once it had brewed, it smelled a lot less nice as the dill and onion tones started to come out and overpower the fennel.  As for the taste, it's pretty bad.  I don't like it at all.  The fennel gets buried under too much dill and onion, and it's just not good...Spinach Chive:  This tea bag just smells bad.  I don't quite know why, but that's about all I can say to describe it.  Once brewed, it smelled...equally bad.  I didn't care for the flavor either.  I think that's the fault of the concept, though, as I just don't think there's anything they could do to spinach and chives to make it into an appealing drink.  I will say though, that the chives flavor comes out stronger than the spinach, so if you like chives, then this might be okay for you.Tomato Mint:  This one smells very nice - very minty with just a hint of tomato.  Once it had been brewed, it smelled exactly like the opposite - with the tomato taking over and the mint becoming more subtle.  The taste, though...  None of the mint flavor is apparent at all, and the tomato, while present, is very weakish tasting and unpleasant.  The other flavor that seems to really come out is the pepper.  The whole thing really tastes like an extremely weak version of a tomato soup.  My verdict: not good.Okay, then, so I've gone through all the flavor now, and I can speak about the whole product.  In terms of packaging, it's alright, but the bags tear very easily!  The instructions say \"squeeze the bags\" but you have to be really careful since they are so fragile.  As for the flavors, well, if you read through all my descriptions you'd know that I wasn't really blown away by any of them.  Quite the opposite, in fact.  If I had to absolutely pick the best one, it'd be the carrot curry, but none of them struck me as something I'd want to repeatedly drink.  They all just came across as extremely weak-tasting versions of vegetable soups, or just plain bad, and I can't really recommend any of them.  If you were thinking that these would be a nice alternative to soup broths, you'll be disappointed since they are so weak-tasting as to be unsatisfying in this regard.  If you are thinking of trying these as a nice alternative to your normal tea, then just don't.  They are all too nasty to really be enjoyable.  Stick to a nice rose petal, mint, rooibos or other herbal tea, unsweetened or using stevia, if you want a low-calorie, caffeine-free drink.  Or heck, just stick to your normal black, white or green tea.  Just about anything is better than this, in my opinion.  Of course, everyone has different tastes, so at least this variety sampler pack exists so you can try all the flavors out for a minimal cost before you commit to any of them.  So, in that regard, I'd definitely recommend you try the sampler pack out before buying an entire box of any one of these flavors.

This is one:==========================================================Review of Harmful Gastrointestinal Effects of Carrageenan in Animal ExperimentsJoanne K. TobacmanCollege of Medicine, University of Iowa, Iowa City, Iowa, USAIn this article I review the association between exposure to carrageenan and the occurrence of colonic ulcerations and gastrointestinal neoplasms in animal models.Although the International Agency for Research on Cancer in 1982 identified sufficient evidence for the carcinogenicity of degraded carrageenan in animals to regard it as posing a carcinogenic risk to humans, carrageenan is still used widely as a thickener, stabilizer, and texturizer in a variety of processed foods prevalent in the Western diet.I reviewed experimental data pertaining to carrageenan's effects with particular attention to the occurrence of ulcerations and neoplasms in association with exposure to carrageenan. In addition, I reviewed from established sources mechanisms for production of degraded carrageenan from undegraded or native carrageenan and data with regard to carrageenan intake.Review of these data demonstrated that exposure to undegraded as well as to degraded carrageenan was associated with the occurrence of intestinal ulcerations and neoplasms. This association may be attributed to contamination of undegraded carrageenan by components of low molecular weight, spontaneous metabolism of undegraded carrageenan by acid hydrolysis under conditions of normal digestion, or the interactions with intestinal bacteria.Although in 1972, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration considered restricting dietary carrageenan to an average molecular weight > 100,000, this resolution did not prevail, and no subsequent regulation has restricted use. Because of the acknowledged carcinogenic properties of degraded carrageenan in animal models and the cancer-promoting effects of undegraded carrageenan in experimental models, the widespread use of carrageenan in the Western diet should be reconsidered.Environ Health Perspect 109:983-994 (2001).==========================================================I contacted the vendor to inquire of this, below is their answer:==============================================Discussion Thread---------------------------------------------------------------Response Via Email (Nancy Bruland) - 10/02/2013 04:55 PMDear Al,Thank you for contacting Organic Valley.For quite some time we've been actively seeking to reformulate our cream, chocolate milk, eggnog and soy milks in order to eliminate the need for carrageenan.

The pictogram directions show that you should pour the powder into the glass before adding water to capture more of the bubbles.EBoost contains 500 mg of potasium per serving  which is generally a healthy mineral but probably contributes some of the unpleasant metallic notes to the flavor. As with most vitamin supplements it is unlikely that this one is really improves immunity, energy or focus.  These appear to be typical supplement  puffery and nonsense which if done carefully are able to avoid FDA scrutiny. In addition the extreme levels of several of the supplements are questionable and may be poorly tolerated or even unhealthy if you use the maximum dose of 4 servings daily.  The most extreme is Vitamin B12 at 2500 mcg per serving.  This is 417 times the (recommended) daily value for Vitamin B12. There is also  1000 mg of Vitamin C giving about 17 times the daily value.  The maximum daily use of 4 EBoost servings would provide double the recommended \"tolerated upper limit\" of Vitamin C and could cause diarrhea.

In addition, I encountered both skins (as noted by others) plus several bits of tough inedible woody material - perhaps a bit of pepper stalk, or actual wood, or some other mystery fibrous substance.Lastly, I fail to see anything convenient about the packaging - heat the soup in the bag and pour into a bowl or pour the soup from a can to a bowl and heat - what's the difference?

Overall, they got decent reviews on Amazon, and they are Keebler, which told me that they were probably as good as any other graham crackers.  WOW, WAS I WRONG!  From the first bite, I knew these were nothing like my favorite Honey Maid graham crackers, which, by the way, are not available on Subscribe & Save at the time of this review.

Somehow, Keebler figured out how to make a bad graham cracker.  Since our kids usually eat most of them, we were concerned about the hardness of the crackers.  At first, I thought I would just eat them myself to put them out of their misery, but I could not bear the thought.  Therefore, I figured I would go onto Amazon and actually go through the hassle of canceling my subscription to the crackers and returning the 6 boxes we had just received.  It was then that I learned there are NO RETURNS on the crackers.  I might end up feeding them to the birds, but I fear they will turn their beaks up when they taste them, or don't taste them, as it turns out.  THEY HAVE NO TASTE!

The rest of the cookie tastes stale, preservative-laden, and a bit mushy, not my idea of a good cookie.

{"reviewText": "The headline actually says it all- I'm really not sure what else to add. As far as the nutrients and such go, it looks pretty typical. The cost is also about the same as other powdered formulas and the fact that it's certified organic is something of a plus. When I cracked open the first container, I noticed it had a very distinctive (and not entirely pleasant) odor. I don't really know how to describe it, other than it sure didn't smell like any other formula I've used. I figured, eh- it's probably because the others were milk based- and proceeded to measure out 3 bottles worth.Well, as noted the baby refused to drink it. We've previously used Enfamil Premium Newborn and Infant, Kirkland, and Bright Beginnings Premium. The little one has NEVER refused a bottle when hungry, even when switching between brands. The first time we changed to Kirkland she gave us a little frown as if to say 'hm, this tastes a bit different,' but then she went right on and drank it all down.With this Vermont Organics soy formula, she took one suck and stopped- started screaming as mom tried to get her to take more. Fortunately I still had other cans of other brand formulas, and we prepped another bottle with Bright Beginnings. She promptly drank it all down. There is really no question that she simply refuses this particular formula. We now have 4 full cans of this and have no idea what to do with it- we might try it again when she gets a bit older and see if it takes (will update then if so... she's 3 months old now).Aside from the baby not taking it, the plastic scoop is basically tossed in and buried somewhere in the big and deep can. You'll need to excavate to get it out- not a very fun or clean task.Recommendation: if you are going to give this a shot, do NOT buy this 4 pack of 23 oz cans. It's definitely not your typical powdered formula- get a small can (sample if possible) and see if the baby likes it first. Otherwise you'll have 4 rather large $20 paperweights.", "summary": "Baby refuses to take it", "overall": 1.0}

Another thing, the milk in the disc tastes sour, but when you add sugar, there is a decent flavor there.

Additionally, both of us detected no hint of berry or kiwi flavor.  Neither of these problems is surprising when looking at the ingredients.  It is made from juice concentrates + water to reconstitute, and the first two juices are apple and grape, so no wonder it tastes like apple (or white grape).  The mild carbonation that is there is insufficient to cut the excessive sugariness of this juice, which makes it have a very thick and non-refreshing mouth-feel.  I think it needs more carbonated water (or serve with crushed ice and let it melt for a while), and it definitely needs more actual  kiwi and berry fruit flavor.Next we compared Switch Kiwi Berry to Trader Joe's similar Strawberry Kiwi Juice.  The Trader Joe's juice actually tastes like strawberry & kiwi, and is not too sweet, and not too thick on the tongue to be refreshing.  So it is possible to make a juice of these flavors that is actually good.Finally, it is in a very stylish slim can, which means that it does not hold very much: 8 oz specifically (the usual canned soft drink contains 12 oz).By the way, fruit sugar (fructose) is still sugar, and this drink is full of it.  When they say \"no *added* sugar\", that means they didn't add any *more* to the overly sweet apple and grape concentrates they were using, which is not the same thing as saying \"no sugar\" or \"no sucrose\" (table sugar).disclaimer: we do not drink sugary soft drinks, so if you do, you may like this one.", "summary": "Tastes like overly sweet apple juice, Trader Joe's version is better", "overall": 1.0}

He told me the chemical in Maca is LEAD, and that the State of CA mandates whenever the concentration of lead is 0.5 mcg/day or greater, the warning notice is required. When questioned, he stated that Maca's lead content is lower than this. But how could that be, if CA only requires a warning notice of birth defects, etc. if the concentration of lead is 0.5 mcg/day or greater? Just doesn't compute. He promised to send me an email explaining \"everything.\" This turned out to be a form letter from Zach Adelman, CEO and Founder of Navitas Naturals, stating the CA requirement, and saying it was much greater than the FDA's threshold for lead-risk disclosure. Well, ok Zach, but what you don't say is exactly what the mcg/day concentration of Lead in Maca actually is. You'd think he'd deal with this, but he totally ignores it. So we know it's greater than 0.5 mcg/day, but how much greater? And, if you think the FDA, which has a well-deserved reputation for being the 'Government's Most Dysfunctional Agency,' is protecting our health risks about lead, I have a bridge to sell you. A follow-up email to Navitas asking this very question has, as of this writing, gone unanswered. As I often say in my line of work \"big red flag.\" And, CA is a leading state, so I wouldn't discount their birth defect or other reproductive harm risk at greater than 0.5 mcg/day. Unless you're a company trying to sell a lot of (unhealthy) product. Then, to make a buck, you try to down-play it.Update: April 28, 2014.  Just received an email from another Navitas customer service person who just quotes the company spin: lead is naturally occurring and that their level (which he doesn't disclose) is below the FDA threshold.

As of today (May 3, 2014), no response from anyone at Navitas.Update: May 5, 2014 Received an email from Arthur Mullin, Product Specialist at Navitas  who stated \"Testing of our Raw Maca Powder showed a lead level of 0.42mcg per gram or 2mcg per serving.\" The serving size, per their package, is 1 teaspoon (an incredibly small amount for any health-oriented person who is likely using a LOT more in their health drink, etc.) But even at the miniscule 1 teaspoon, that works out to 300% more than California's threshold warning level of 0.5 mcg/day. Use a more realistic amount, just a tablespoon (15 grams), and you're up to 6.3 mcg, or about 1,200% more than California's threshold warning level for lead. Arthur also mentioned it's below the FDA's recommended maximum limit, but as I mentioned above,  if you think the FDA, which has a well-deserved reputation for being the 'Government's Most Dysfunctional Agency,' is protecting our health risks about lead, I have a bridge to sell you.", "summary": "\"WARNING: THIS PRODUCT CONTAINS A CHEMICAL KNOWN TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO CAUSE BIRTH DEFECTS OR OTHER REPRODUCTIVE HARM\"", "overall": 1.0}
{"reviewText": "I love Italian salad dressing and used bottled Wishbone or Good Seasons Italian for years, until I noticed suddenly a few years back that every time I ate salad with any bottled dressing at all - not just Wishbone - that I had a terribly upset stomach afterwards.  I started reading labels and as it turned out, virtually all of them had moved to using canola oil, something that I am rather sensitive to.  Since that time, I've made it a habit to just whip up a batch of vinaigrette, something that takes not a speck more time than mixing up this packet of dressing, and I've become much more watchful of what things like this contain.When I went to reconstitute an envelope of the dressing mix a couple of hours ago, I was very surprised to see that they call for 1/3 cup vinegar, 1/3 cup water and a mere 1/3 cup of oil.  This 1/1/1 ratio is FAR different than any standard salad dressing recipe I've ever seen.  Those invariably call for either 1  part vinegar to 3 parts oil or 1 part vinegar to 4 parts oil.  By rights, this dressing mix should call for 1 to 1 1/3 cups of oil, not a mere 1/3 cup. I was even more surprised when I read the ingredients list.As you may be aware, US labeling law requires that ingredients be listed in descending order of their representative amount in the product, so the first ingredient listed on the box - sugar - makes up the greatest part of this salad dressing mix.  That ingredient is followed immediately by salt - a full 12%  of your Recommended Daily Allowance.Close examination of the ingredients list also shows the presence of filler ingredients you may not be aware of:Corn Maltodextrin is in fact a form of sugar, one that is absorbed into the blood stream as readily as pure glucose.Xanthan Gum is a filler used to  add viscosity to things.  It is a carbohydrate.Autolyzed Yeast Extract is a cheap substitute for Monosodium Glutamate (MSG) and does in fact contain some free MSG.  It is the subject of controversy.Lest you think that this product is Gluten Free, note the last line of the ingredients - \"May Contain Wheat, Egg, Soy & Milk.\"Grandma's $0.02 - I found this product FAR too vinegary and FAR too sweet with a distinct dried garlic aftertaste, flavors that intensify over time.

The monk fruit, the basis of this sweetener, can be used in high-heat cooking, which Stevia cannot.But, read the label before you decide that this product is for you, because monk fruit is not the only ingredient. In fact, it's the third ingredient of four:1.  Erythrytol -- it's a sugar alcohol that's 60 to 70 percent sweeter than sugar, which occurs naturally through the fermentation of fruits. Industrially, it's fermented with glucose and a yeast. Unlike other sugar alcohols, erythrytol is less likely to cause gastric side-effects (gas and diarrhea) and it does not effect blood sugar.2.  Sugar3.  Monk fruit -- this fruit is 150% sweeter than sugar. It's derived from luo han guo, which is a Chinese gourd family.4.  MolassesWhile the label says this is non-caloric, note there is one gram of carbohydrates listed on the label. That's four calories per teaspoon. That's less than the 15 calories per teaspoon of sugar and Nectress should not have the same effect as sugar on your blood glucose, but it's still got calories and if you consume a lot of Nectresse, it's going to add up. NOTE: The serving size of Nectress is 1/4 tsp. That's one calorie per serving.It's debatable whether Nectresse is natural, either. Sugar comes from beets, which have been genetically modified. Also, the molasses and sugar alcohol components are suspect.Nectresse comes in a small plastic container with two pop-ups on the lid: one for pouring and the other for spooning. It looks like granulated sugar, the only difference is a slight peachy cast which I am guessing is from the monk fruit or the molasses.REVISED CONTENT:  A commenter pointed out that I was using the wrong serving size for Nectress, So, I tried again--or did as close to a trial as I could.The appropriate serving size is 1/4 teaspoon. I have a couple of measuring spoon sets and none go down past 1/2, so I did my best to judge a serving based on using a bit less than 1/2 of the 1/2 teaspoon measure.Not so sickly sweet, at least. I drink 12 to 16 ounces of hot tea at a time and I like it a bit sweeter, so I added another 1/4 teaspoon. That's just about right in the taste department. Nectress still left me wanting to rinse out my mouth though not as badly as when I OD'd on it.

{"reviewText": "I've recently switched to drinking instant coffee due to time constraints and other reasons I won't get into on here. Let's just say I've drank hundreds of cups of instant over the last few months. Before drinking instant, I drank tea almost exclusively. Aside from being a former tea addict, I've had an appreciation of well brewed coffee in the past. My favorite coffee is Melitta's Sun & Moon organic. It's simply the best coffee I've ever had with perfect balance of rich taste and complexity. Formerly, when living in San Francisco, I really had no reason to ever go into Starbucks because there was always a Peet's near by, or a local coffee house. So I think I know a good cup of coffee.Alright, now I'll get onto the instant coffees I've tried. I've drank Folgers instant, which has an awful chemical taste but it's tolerable for instant, I've drank Fred Meyer's organic select, which is actually quite good and doesn't have much of a nauseating aftertaste. I've had nescafe, which also has the awful instant chemical aftertaste. How does Starbucks VIA compare to these brands? It has the same nauseating checmical aftertaste of Folgers and Nescafe.Starbucks VIA can be described as having sweet acrid bloom when it first hits your mouth that turns into chemical sweetness nauseating finish that makes you want to pour the whole thing out. There's no denying this is an instant. It's also a mediocre instant compared to generic organic select I've tried (which surprises me, honestly). I have no idea why someone would pay a premium for this, except they're very gullible and easily manipulated through brand loyalty and corporate marketing. Strange to me people would spend so much on an instant that comes in very environmentally unconscious packaging, costs almost 10x as much as any other instant, and tastes mediocre and only review it highly because it has Starbucks familiarity to naive and gullible consumers.Next to try is Jacobs Krunung instant coffee, and I'm hoping for better results. Which shouldn't be too hard considering Starbucks VIA is one of the worst instants I've tried so far.Thanks for taking the time to read my review and I strongly urge you to try purchasing Organic instant or perhaps Jacobs Krunung instead.", "summary": "Terrible", "overall": 1.0}

I saw a review in which the person said this was a good product but the casing was like eating wax paper and this would cause this person not reordering this pepperoni. Laugh OUT LOUD !!!!!!!!!!!! This person did not take off the second wrap! HAHAHAHAHA yes You ate the wax paper! There is a clear plastic outer wrap and you open that up and then there is a very thin what appears to be butchers wax paper around the pepperoni and it is so soaked with the juices and perhaps during the curing process, it has taken on the color of the pepperoni and has shrunk tightly around the pepperoni.Anyone who knows how to EAT basically can see that this is an outer layer! SO people ignore that rating, this pepperoni is good stuff, very spicy, very greasy it is a dry cured meat is not like your standard store bought pepperoni. This has the texture more like one of your convenient store pepperoni sticks. It is about 15 inches long and I want to say close to 2 inches in diameter. You would need a very sharp knife to cut it. I would if I were you, I would use much less than you are used to using on a pizza. This product really does have a strong pepperoni taste which is part of the charm of this form pepperoni.

But if your intent is to go wheat free in the sense of the book Wheat Bellies and avoid high glycemic index foods that promote high insulin and fat retention - this is NOT the product to do it.  As indicated in the Wheat Bellies blog ...Wheat raises blood sugar higher than nearly all other foods, including table sugar and many candy bars. The few foods that increase blood sugar higher than even wheat include figs, dates, and other dried fruits, and rice starch, cornstarch, tapioca starch, and potato starch-the most common ingredients used in gluten-free foods. A gluten-free whole grain bread, for instance, is usually made with a combination of brown rice, potato, and tapioca starches. These dried pulverized starches are packed with highly-digestible high-glycemic index carbohydrates and thereby send blood sugar through the roof. This contributes to diabetes, cataracts, arthritis, heart disease and growing belly fat. This is why many celiac patients who forego wheat and resort to gluten-free foods become fat and diabetic. Gluten-free foods as they are currently manufactured are very poor substitutes for wheat flour.I took a look at this product so that I may have some bread - wheat free.

{"reviewText": "I was expecting so much.  Maybe because I'm a full leaf tea drinker I've gotten accustomed to a different chai taste.  This has a mild to medium spice to it, about a 4 on a scale of 1 - 10 (I also like a heavy spice in my chai but most people don't so I'm not holding the level of spice against it), but the spices don't fully taste like what the REAL spices should taste like.  At first it kinda does but then you realize it is not real.  Like comparing REAL vanilla extract to imitation.Then, to add to the chemical spice taste, it has artificial sweetener added.  Ok, I drink Coke zero, so it is not like I'm totally against fake sugars.  But this thing has a fake sweetener taste that REALLY lingers on my tongue.  And it is almost too sweet.  I usually put 2 - 3 teaspoons to a 8-10 oz mug of tea when I brew it full leaf.  So I do like my stuff sweet.  But this is almost an overpowering sweet taste.In all, there was nothing really redeeming about it.  I tried mixing one K-cup with some instant chai latte I picked up at the grocery store (which used real sugar and had no hydrogenated stuff in it, but barely had any chai spice flavor to it) but it didn't help.  The weird chemical tastes still overpowered.  Just not worth the time or money for me.Edited to add:I want to add that I'm not opposed to flavored products (either artificially or naturally flavored).  I pretty much only drink flavored coffees, and most of the teas available from places like the zillion dollar an ounce whole leaf tea places like the one whose name melds the words \"Tea\" and \"Nirvana\"  (which I shamefully admit to shopping at) are naturally/artificially flavored. So I wasn't being fussy about the flavor because they added artificial flavors in the ingredients and I was expecting something all natural.Side note on differences between artificial and natural flavors in ingredients: When something says naturally flavored in the ingredients or the side of the box, it just means the chemical they use has a real \"counterpart\" in nature, whereas an artificial flavor will not. So a flavor like blue raspberry will always be labelled artificially flavored, while a flavor like raspberry might say naturally flavored.  But, they both are flavored via lab produced chemicals. So as far as I'm concerned natural flavors are still an artificial product (unless actual oils are used, like Earl Grey Tea using bergamont oils). When I say this product has an artificially flavored TASTE I mean the taste TO ME does not taste like something in nature, even if it technically is trying to copy flavors (spices) that exist in nature. I hope I didn't confuse things more with my explanations.To Cafe Escapes' credit, there WERE some real spices (actual spices, not just spice flavoring) in there. This is evident because this is basically an instant powder they placed in a K-cup and the entire contents of the K-cup end up in your tea mug, so I notices some finely ground stuff spices in the mug after drinking.  So I applaud them for that.  At the same time though, there are lots of better quality instant mixes that one can just spoon into a cup and add hot water to that cost a fraction of these K-cups.  So that is why I believe this product truly isn't worth purchasing.Sorry for my ramblings, I hope I could help with what I meant in my review.

We were excited for the opportunity to try different blends before purchasing an entire (pricey) box of any one flavor.To preface: I enjoy flavored coffees. French vanilla, mocha, hazelnut... Pretty much any variety available. I was really excited to try Gloria Jean's Hazelnut since it was one of the few flavored options in the sample pack. I typically enjoy smooth medium roasts and I can't stand bitter coffee with a pungent aftertaste.Unfortunately, though, this brew is without-a-doubt undrinkable. So bitter and thick. I couldn't believe this was supposed to be a flavored blend. It smelled burnt as soon as it was brewed. We brewed an 8 ounce cup since typically flavored coffees tend to be weaker so we assumed brewing the smaller size cup would allow us to enjoy to most flavor. The coffee was dark in appearance and both my boyfriend and I tried it befor dumping it out in the sink because the taste was so foul.Aside from its burnt flavor and bitter aftertaste, it's also worth mentioning that I couldn't detect any hazelnut notes at all. Very disappointing.I'd never tried a Gloria Jean brand coffee before and now I'm nervous to try another. I might attempt the Butter Toffee flavor if I can find it in a small pack.

So after receiving the tea, I mixed it up per the instructions and took a sip. Yowzas! The tea was super sweet with a bit of strawberry flavor and no tea that I could taste. I ended up watering the tea down enough that one packet, which is usually two servings, ends up as four or five 8-oz. servings. The berry flavor became very diluted while there was still that taste of icky sweetness. Overall the berry flavors and tea are weak, even undiluted, and I noticed no honey flavor what-so-ever, so took a look-see at the ingredients where I spotted sucralose (an artificial sweetener) thrown right in the middle of things. Now that is where the sweetness is and don't take kindly to that addition, as I avoid artificial sweeteners whenever possible. Seeing as how Lipton is sneakily claiming this is sweetened with honey (And look! NO aspartame!), with no mention that in actuality the sweeteners are honey granules, which are made from both honey and sugar, and sucralose except by viewing the ingredients list, makes me angry because I've been swindled. Yeah, this is natural all right. I'm definitely not going to trust Lipton's marketing from now on and urge them to think about switching to a natural sweetener such as stevia. So if you like your food natural, best to skip this, but if you're not so picky and don't mind artificial sweeteners in your food, then give it a go if you're interested. I'll not be trying any other flavors of this product.", "summary": "Beware Advertising!", "overall": 1.0}

{"reviewText": "UPDATE: April 3, 2009I \"ordered\" this drink through the Vine program based upon the description (see below).  I was hoping that it would be what it claimed: \"A HEALTHY ALTERNATIVE.\"  Upon getting this drink I realized that it was actually a fruit juice product, which as such cannot be \"healthy.\"  Fruit juice consumption is one of the larger contributing/leading causes of weight gain.  Therefore the following review is an exposition of why I, along with the dietitians and nurses that I work with at the Veterans Administration, have rated this a one star product.As an avid diet soda drinker who consumes at least 100 ounces per day, I am always looking for alternatives.  Sadly, Switch is anything but that.  Switch is little more than Shasta (TM) non-caffeinated sodas, but with a few more calories!  The \"diet\" drink I was hoping it would be, turned out to be nothing short of \"off the diet.\"  As far as I am concerned, Switch is a \"wolf in lamb's clothing\" for those who consider themselves \"heath conscious.\"The description, which is rhetoric at its best, states:\"The Switch is a great tasting HEALTHY ALTERNATIVE [emphasis added] to soda. The Switch is 100% juice that is carbonated and contains 100% of DV [Daily Value--not Recommended Daily Amount--based on a 2000 calorie diet] of Vitamin C. It has no sugar added and contains nothing artificial. Its just juice, bubbles and Vitamin C. You'll love The Switch because it has the bold taste and nutritional value of a FORTIFIED [emphasis added] juice, with the carbonated refreshment of a soda.  The Switch is 100% of what you want in a soda, and 0% of what you don't[.]\"Here is what the label actually provides--again, based upon what they call Daily Value (DV), similar to regular sodas:Serving Size: 8.3 fl oz (245 ml)Servings [per can]: 1Total Fat: 0g  0% DVSodium: 15mg  1% DVTotal Carb: 34g  11% DVSUGAR [emphasis added]: 33gProtein: 0g  0% DVThen separately listed:Vitamin C: 100%There is no direct indication of the amount of Vitamin C, nor is there any direct indication that the Vitamin C--contrary to their description--is not added; just as the sodium is added.  Since it is listed separately, and other sodas indicate they are NOT a source of Vitamin C, I must conclude that the Vitamin C does not come from the juice, but is added.Relative to the regular soda that I am currently drinking (I grabbed the wrong bottle), Coca-Cola Cherry (TR), Switch Black Cherry has 6g more carbohydrates (listed as \"Carb\" above), but 10mg more sodium--although both amounts are listed as 1% of the Daily Value--than 8oz of the Coca-Cola Cherry (TR) soda pop.As for actual ingredients, here is a comparison of Switch Black Cherry and Coca-Cola Cherry (TR):Switch: 100% JUICE (FILTERED SPARKLING WATER SUFFICIENT TO RECONSTITUTE JUICE CONCENTRATES, APPLE, GRAPE, KIWI, ACEROLA, RASPBERRY AND STRAWBERRY JUICE CONCENTRATES), NATURAL FLAVORS, ASCORBIC ACID (VITAMIN C).Coca-Cola (TR): CARBONATED WATER, HIGH FRUCTOSE CORN SYRUP, CARMEL COLOR, PHOSPHORIC ACID, NATURAL FLAVORS, CAFFEINE [23 mg/8 fl oz].Given that acerola is high in Vitamin C, and used in baby foods, I am unsure why ascorbic acid is added to the Switch.  Phosphoric acid is added to soda and other foods to acidify them; that is, to give them a tangy or sour taste--which is derived from the fruit in Switch--at a lower cost that extracting it from fruit.  The carbohydrates in the Switch drink are primarily from the juice, while the corn syrup provides all the carbohydrates in the Coca-Cola (TR).  So, in the end, the only real inexpedience difference in the source of carbohydrates; excluding the added caffeine to this particular soda.That leaves taste.  And to be honest, I prefer sugar substituted soft drinks--and was hoping that Switch would be a way to avoid using sugar substitutes, since some poorly done research suggests that sugar substitutes lead to people consuming more calories (a whole different story, but one I was hoping that Switch would help with).  That said, I must agree with other reviewers that I found the drink to be overly sweet, as did the four other people with whom I shared this drink.  Indeed, I would compare Switch Black Cherry with Crystal Light or Sam's Choice with sugar substitute made with too little Club Soda.But drinking Switch MAY BE COOL!?", "summary": "At 135 Calories Per 8 Ounces, This Was Not What I Was Hoping For", "overall": 1.0}

{"reviewText": "Yes, you read that right. The standard, non-diet version of Swiss Miss cocoa in packets or canisters now contains the artificial sweetener sucralose, aka Splenda. For those of us who have negative effects from it, or who simply wish to avoid it, this is bad news.What's worse is that they never indicated that it changed. There's no Splenda logo on the box. There's no mention of it anywhere except in the ingredients list. Granted, it's near the bottom which means there isn't as much in this as there is in the sugar-free or diet versions, but it's still there and I do not want to ingest it. I would have appreciated a warning.So as much as I loved Swiss Miss cocoa, I had to put it on my \"do not buy\" list. Now I buy a store brand cocoa that doesn't have sucralose in it.If you're one of those people who has a problem with food manufacturers silently slipping sucralose into your diet, then I'd advise you to steer clear of the Swiss Miss line, and NEVER take it for granted that the \"regular\" version of any hot cocoa is sweetened naturally. Chances are, most of the ones you like are using sucralose now, and then never mentioned it.So I give this product ONE star. That's for slipping the sucralose in without clearly labeling it, and for changing the formula that I once loved.

{"reviewText": "So diet root beer is probably the hardest taste out there to get tasting anything like the real product, to the point that it almost becomes two separate drinks. The harsh aftertaste of anise and wintergreen often seems to dominate the diet versions, and the harsher sweetness of artificial & alternative sweeteners lacks the mellowing effect that sugar gives. As a rule, they tend to be more carbonated, and therefore more acidic. Overall, it's a taste I hate and others seem to love.I only mention this because Zevia is absolutely no different; in my opinion, it tastes exactly like diet A&W; in every way, with the added bonus of bloating. I don't have enough experience with Stevia or Erythritol to blame it on one or the other, but it has a very similar effect to anything with sucralose, sugar alcohols or anything else the body considers high-fiber, which is really weird because they're supposed to be the bloat-free alternatives. I don't understand why they cloned the signature diet taste, instead of using stevia's unique taste profile to create a new kind of diet root beer. Presumably, it's just another example of using cheap flavorants instead of really good ones.Given the high price compared to nearly identical aspartame-sweetened drinks, it's a total fail in my book.", "summary": "Overpriced with identical taste to Diet A&W", "overall": 1.0}

Mine is not the palate you'd want to have judging a chocolate dessert competition, that's for sure... but I reluctantly took a sip.

{"reviewText": "&#2951; Fuzzy Wuzzy's Summary:&#1150; Avoid this product! This product gives me ice cold pricklies.First of all, if you are highly sensitive to MSG or glutamates, you should not use this product.  Although I tend to avoid products containing MSG, I am not sensitive or allergic to it, and MSG and all its glutamate-containing variants are far more ubiquitous in processed foods than many of us realize.The ingredients in each of the four packets of this Knorr \"Mi Arroz\" rice seasoning are: salt, monosodium glutamate, natural and artificial flavor (whatever that means??), citric acid, hydrolyzed corn protein, autolyzed yeast extract (barley), tomato powder, maltodextrin, silicon dioxide, cellulose gum,  sugar, caramel color,  disodium inosinate, Yellow 6, annatto (color), partially hydrogenated soybean oil, beet powder (color), Red 40, Yellow 5, Paprika Oleoresin (color).  Although the box shows a tomato and a onion, there is no onion powder used in this seasoning mix; the seasoning only contains tomato powder.  Hmmm...  The MSG and autolyzed yeast extract both contain glutamates, although autolyzed yeast has less glutamate concentration than MSG.  Both of these ingredients, along with disodium inosinate, are designed to provide a savory umami taste.  Your tongue actually has taste bud receptors that specifically taste for glutamates and favorably respond to the savory flavor of glutamates.  Prior to the discovery of the fifth basic taste of umami, only four basic taste receptors were believed to exist on the tongue: sweet, salty, sour, bitter.  Now there are five acknowledged taste sensations that we all have in our mouths, with a sixth possible taste possibly being for fat.  The umami taste is a savory brothy sensation that MSG and all its glutamate variants appeases.  A person's first experience with the umami taste may be with mother's breast milk, which has as much umami taste as a brothy soup.  Glutamates naturally occur in a wide variety of foods such as seafood, meats, mushrooms, vegetables, green tea, and various fermented or aged products such as cheeses, soy sauce, and many sauces and pastes that are sold in jars.While some people are really sensitive and intolerant of glutamates, many people just say that they are intolerant to MSG although they may be consuming large quantities of glutamates in foods that do not contain MSG and they still feel fine nonetheless.  Studies have shown that up to 15% of people in the U.S. *believe* that they have a food allergy, but when they are specifically tested for food allergies, only 3% to 4% of people in the U.S. actually have a food allergy.  There are many factors that can give you a headache or upset stomach after eating a meal instead of blaming MSG or gluten.  Roughly two-thirds of the people who say that they are gluten-intolerant really are not allergic to gluten.  I just mention this because although I prefer natural ingredients and flavorings instead of a packaged food mainly using MSG as its sole source of flavor, I am not averse to the use of MSG and I think that it is over-vilified, especially when compared to the overuse of salt, sugar, and corn syrup in processed foods.  The overuse of corn syrup and its variants has caused far more health issues in the U.S., especially with the rise of type 2 diabetes, than the use of MSG.The front of the box says \"Doesn't stick\" and \"Makes fluffy rice\".  I did not notice my rice becoming any fluffier by using this seasoning.  As to the \"doesn't stick\" claim, the rice is perhaps made slightly less sticky because the seasoning mix includes silicon dioxide, which is the scientific designation for \"sand\" :-)  The silicon dioxide is actually added to this seasoning mix as an anti-caking agent so the seasoning powder can be easily and smoothly poured from the packet instead of clumping together.  When cooked with the rice, while the silicon dioxide does coat the rice and make it slightly less sticky, most kinds of rice will still be sticky.  If your rice was sticky without using this seasoning mix, it will still be somewhat sticky when cooked with this seasoning mix.The instructions for this rice flavoring say to stir-fry 1 1/2 cups of long grain rice with 2 tablespoons of oil, then add 3 cups of water and 1 packet of this \"Mi Arroz\" flavoring, bring to a boil, simmer covered for 18 minutes, and then remove from heat and let stand for 10 minutes.  The resulting rice does have the flavor and slightly savory umami essence of the MSG.  And there is a distinct tomato aroma from the seasoning both while the seasoning is still in the packet and after the rice has been cooked.  But the cooked rice is way too salty for my preference.  I love various spices, herbs, and seasonings added to rice, but I prefer to keep my rice unsalted and let the flavors of other food contribute their salt to the rice.  I dabbed my finger into this \"Mi Arroz\" seasoning packet and tasted the powder before adding it to my rice being cooked.  There is a slight tomato flavor and a more pronounced tomato aroma, but there are no other flavors that I tasted in the seasoning other than salt and more saltiness.  I would have preferred a bit more flavoring added to the packet, either with onion and garlic powder, or some herbs or seasonings.  Three of the key ingredients for any Spanish/Mexican rice are tomatoes, onion, and garlic.The \"Nutrition Facts\" that are printed on the box obfuscates the amount of sodium in each of these four flavor packets by listing the sodium as \"37% DV\".  But when you look at the serving size that the \"37%\" refers to, it is for 1/6th of a packet!  So by emptying one packet into 1 1/2 cups of rice being cooked, you are consuming a monstrous 5280-mg 222% DV quantity of sodium in a small 1 1/2 cup portion of stir-fried rice, which does not even include the salt that you would eat in other foods during the day.  When I tried splitting the packet into three portions, adding one-third of a packet to 1 1/2 cups of stir fried rice, the resulting rice was more lightly salted and I liked it much better.  But then the tomato flavor, which is already subtle when using a whole packet, is also likewise subdued.  So this rice seasoning could have been far better if it had far less sodium and more flavor in each packet.  By comparison, the flavor packet that is included with ramen noodles is also mainly MSG, but most ramen noodles flavor packets have far less sodium and far more flavor than what is contained in this \"Mi Arroz\" packet.  And for a seasoning packet that is mainly salt with little seasoning, this is also more expensive to use than just adding plain salt to your rice.There are dozens of recipes for Spanish/Mexican rice available in cookbooks and online.  If you want to prepare a quick and easy tomato-based Mexican-style stir-fried rice without needing to chop up fresh tomatoes, onions, and garlic, try cooking the rice in oil and adding a can ofRotel Diced Tomato With Green Chilis, 10-Ounce Units (Pack of 24), cook the rice while the fluids from the can of Rotel are absorbed by the rice, and add additional water as needed during the cooking of the rice.  The Rotel canned tomatoes add far more zesty flavor than this \"Mi Arroz\" seasoning, and it also does not have the MSG or extremely high salt content that this seasoning mix has.  If this seasoning mix had far less salt and did not use synthetic food dyes to color the rice red, I would have rated it 3 stars, instead of 1 stars.  And if this seasoning mix had far less salt, more spice seasonings, at least including some onion powder and garlic powder, and did not use synthetic food dyes, I would have possibly rated this 4 stars.  But this is too salty to cook just 1 1/2 cups of rice with each seasoning packet, unless you like all of your foods to be heavily salted.The Rotel tomato blend also uses mostly natural unprocessed ingredients, whereas one-third of this seasoning packet's ingredients were added solely for the purpose of adjusting the color of the rice.  Three of the six coloring agents used in this seasoning mix are synthetic food dyes with questionable safety records: Yellow 5, Yellow 6, and Red 40.  Yellow 5, Yellow 6, and Red 40 have all been linked to hyperactivity and possible ADHD in children, and all three of them have caused cancers in laboratory animals.  Yellow 5, Yellow 6, and Red 40 are frequently contaminated with benzidine, which is a human and animal carcinogen permitted by the FDA in low levels in dyes.  Bound benzidine also has been detected in these dyes in much greater amounts than free benzidine, but routine FDA tests measure only free benzidine contaminants.  Intestinal enzymes release bound benzidine, so we could be exposed to vastly greater amounts of the benzidine carcinogen than FDA's tests indicate when they tested these synthetic dyes only for the presence of free benzidine contaminants.  A simple seasoning mix like this should not need to use three synthetic food dyes to give it a more uniform red color.  The risks associated with consuming these food dyes are greater than the risks from eating too much salt or MSG.  This seasoning packet should have just relied on the tomato powder, beet powder, and annatto to provide a red color instead of also adding these synthetic food dyes!", "summary": "A quick way to make Mexican/Spanish rice, but it has way too much salt, not enough spices, and three suspect synthetic food dyes", "overall": 1.0}

I use it only raw, so I can fully appreciate its flavor.I was really pleased to see it here on Amazon, at a price that is slightly lower than in any local stores.What a huge disappointment it was to see, upon delivery, that the bottle was cheap transparent plastic.Decent quality extra virgin olive oil MUST be in glass bottles or at most cans (e.g. Carli oil has some big cans along with glass bottles), even better if dark glass, because light also deteriorates its quality. I am Italian, in Italy extra virgin olive oil is a staple and people use a lot of it. But I have never seen any extra virgin oil sold in plastic, in 24 years that I've lived in Italy.I could not believe that they ruined the Bertolli oil storing it in cheap plastic, and the taste reflects this poor storage. It does not nearly have the same rich taste as the oil that is stored in glass. I believe this is because it has been stored for too long in that worthless bottle. It expires in 1 year so probably it was bottled about 10 months ago.This oil as it is in the plastic is really not worth the price, for the taste it has, you can find some better oils for lower price (while to me the Bertolli oil in glass bottles is UNBEATABLE for its rich taste, and I have tried many many oils).This is why I am canceling my subscription and I am going back buying again the same oil in a local store that sells it in respectable glass bottles.You can google \"extra virgin olive oil plastic\" and you'll find many results that advice to stay away from plastic bottles as oils absorb PVCs a lot, even at room temperature. This is unhealthy and it also affects the taste of the oil. Some people think this is no big deal because they cannot notice any difference in taste. But it is a matter of fact that, even if you cannot taste anything different, the oil deteriorates in plastic. Many other foods are perfectly fine stored in plastic, I am not against plastic at all!

I have also read that Oyster mushrooms are relatively easy to grow, so I had high hopes for this kit.

I soaked the log, I misted faithfully and made sure it was in the proper light, but nothing. After I saw that it was going to be a dud, I tried re-soaking the \"log\" again, but that didn't work either. I'm really surprised and disappointed that I couldn't make this work.

These fruit snacks are marketed to make you think they are healthier than the usual Scooby Doo, SpongeBob, or Dora and etc., fruit snacks. The truth is though, that these are just as much of a sugary, processed, worthless ingredient filled fruit snack. Sure the kids will like them - they are a pile of molded gelatin and sugar. They have the same artificial flavors/taste as all the other fruit snacks, as well.It is a bit disheartening that Kellogg's and other companies try to be sneaky with their advertising and the way they present their products. It's just like their claim on their Frosted Mini Wheats that they help kids stay focused in school, so they can perform better in school. The fact of the claim is that a child who is not starving from a missed breakfast will not be distracted by their empty tummy and will not be praying time flies so they can get to lunch an eat.. and therefore the child will be paying more attention to the teacher and focusing on their schoolwork. Any filling breakfast would have the same effect - not just Frosted Mini Wheats. There's no special ingredient in Mini Wheats that helps a child to stay focused. It's just that with a full tummy, they won't be sitting in class thinking of how hungry they are. I know this little tidbit/rant does not really have anything to do with these fruit snacks, but it just goes to show how Kellogg's \"values\" it's customers/consumers.. they value us enough to try and be misleading. In the end, it is up to the consumer to research, look at ingredients etc, but a lot of consumers trust these big brands and their claims.So, anyway, back to the fruit snacks - they are a typical sugary treat that is not something you would want to eat or serve your child everyday.

The box is very fun for the kids to look at.  My oldest spent about 20 mintues just looking at the pictures on the outside of the box.  Finding the tatoo inside was a suprise for her as well.  The inside had fun jokes and a word find, along with some interesting factoids.  Better for older child than mine.I had both of them try to assemble the spork and they could.  I think some of the packaging would be tough for a child to open alone.  I opened everything and split it between the two kids.

They thought it was swiss and would not touch it since it was not cold from the fridge.  I served it as it would be if we had it as the box suggests.  I chilled the cheese and they still did not like it.My youngest did not like the turkey stick, oldest ate it all.Both scarffed the gummy bears, but we have these regularly since they are allergen free and natural.Each liked the snap pea crips, another item we have had before.Neither liked the sunflower crunch thing.  Both like sunflower seeds, but this was not a hit.  I thought it was good, but I think they wanted it to either be all salty or more sweet.The strawberry applesauce-not a hit.  My oldest ate it, but said it was not that good.  The youngest did not eat it.  Now these are two kids who love applesauce, I have cups of it, those portable pouches and large bottles.  I tasted it too and think they did not like the strawberry flavor.  It is pretty strong, maybe it would have been better cold?I do have issue with one claim the manufacter has on the box.  It states no added MSG.  Which none of the products have that listed directly, the turkey stick has it in there.  Autolyzed yeast extract is another way of saying MSG.  Check it out online if you do not beleive.  I also did not like that it had sodium nitrate in it.Also the sodium content was way too high.  Healthy does not have 880mg in it.Would I buy this?  No.  My oldest did ask me to buy it again.  Which I explained if you are only going to eat two-three items out of it, I call that a waste of money.

I can see if perhaps 3 out of 10 were, but out of a whole tomato being diced, theres no way it should be 7 out of 12. They must be using lower quality parts for the diced tomato cans.Look closer and you'll notice a faint greenish or more yellow area and when pressed with finger they're hard and dont give like a regular tomato section does. I know I might seem fussy, but the price should alot lower than the cans with larger tomato pieces, not higher.=============================================================================Older review:These are great canned tomatoes, but I don't understand how they were 14.40 in November and now theyre 22.00 ?Also, the BPA situation is serious. But the reason it's still being used is because BPA is essentially an unregulated chemical.  See [...]From page 4 -\"None of the regulatory agencies, all of which are heavily dominated by chemical industry interests\"...they just didn't know what to do with this (a hill of new research)  \"And the choice is, they've got 100,000 chemicals in commerce. They actually have regulatory authority over a small number of them, because in the 1970s with the Toxic Substance Control Act, they grandfathered in 62,000 chemicals, including BPA, that are totally outside the regulatory system. So there's no regulation of BPA\"But in January, 2010, the FDA did something remarkable -- it reversed its position that BPA is safe, and said we agree with our science advisory agency that there is reason for concern for prostate cancer, for early puberty, for a variety of things. This was a huge breakthrough. Now we actually have a government agency that has accepted that this is a chemical to be avoided. But they said, \"We're sorry, but we do not have the authority to do that. We don't even have the authority to go to the chemical industry and say, `What's this in?' We can't even find that out.\" It's a grandfathered chemical.\"\"What the FDA said is, \"We are working with Congress to try to get laws changed.\" But changing the rules that we operate by, if we had a compliant industry, would take five to 10 years. And this is one extremely non-compliant industry. It's almost a $10 billion-a-year product. You know, people don't give up that kind of money.\"---One problem other than early puberty in females (because it mimics estrogens) is the feminization of boys and males (including affecting their development in-vitro from the mother's consumption of BPA as well as soy proteins)  that we don't often read about. This could produce a national security problem, if we are developing feminine boys (watch the feminists scream at me :))Either way, I figured people who purchase organic products would appreciate being made aware of this, if they weren't already :)", "summary": "Noticing more stem top and bottom sections", "overall": 2.0}

I dislike the \"Bailey's Irish Cream\"/butter pecan/you name it -flavored-type coffees--they taste of artificial flavors to me, and the quality of the coffee isn't that good. So I set out to try the new Starbucks ground \"naturally\" flavored coffees...Well, this was rather disappointing. I know that \"natural flavors\" doesn't necessarily mean \"natural vanilla flavor\"-- all it means is that the flavorings are derived from plants and not petroleum--could well be from pine trees. This coffee lists in order the following ingredients: ground coffee, natural flavor (with corn maltodextrin, vegetable glycerin), ground vanilla beans, Indian sarsaparilla root. .... Now, we don't know what the \"natural flavors\" are, but they are something different from ground vanilla beans, and listed before them. The sarsaparilla root is kind of weird too-- sarsaparilla, the beverage, tastes like root beer! Well, this has that \"artificially flavored coffee\" taste--smells and tastes a lot like Bailey's Irish Cream flavored coffee, although the underlying coffee is much better than you might get from a supermarket brand of flavored coffee--it's Starbucks, after all.  I put Splenda in mine, as well as cream--not very pleasant on its own.On the plus side, you can control how sweet you make it, and use the sweetener you prefer--but why not just put a glug of natural vanilla extract or some ground vanilla beans in your regular coffee yourself? That way your coffee maker doesn't get all flavored up, either.and--it's not the 3/4 lb.

{"reviewText": "As you can see, I ordered a set of three boxes of these, happy for free shipping and a good price, which Amazon usually lacks on groceries... and how disappointed I was, not in Amazon but in Numi...I guess too many complained that the SMELL wasn't like other EGs, and they're right... it wasn't. Others spray alcohol-containing, leaf-wrecking oils on the leaves, leaving behind a horrible taste to me and also making the leaves oxidize rapidly, making the tea quality suck! Numi HAD it absolutely perfect. I was ready to tell you how to get, out of their tea, the perfect GENUINE Earl Grey tea, one where the tea wasn't killed by modern techniques of spraying chemicals (essential oils are almost all alcohol, after all; bergamot oil is almost always mixed with cheaper and easier to process citrus that grows far more places than a tiny town in Italy)... and now, I'm just here to say \"move along, nothing here to see\" because in changing their fruit supplier or aging/malting process or -something- (the tea leaves wouldn't likely vary so much, the brews side by side making the same color and the leaves being cut the same way and clearly the same region and process--yes, I'm one of THOSE tea drinkers, Steepster reviews and all), from the bags smelling like another brand, a rather costly one that starts with R and nearly rhymes with fishy, which has rather funky EG (that brand sprays the leaves, which Numi proclaims my shared disdain for)... well, what was--back when they had the boxes with the old man and his walking stick slumped in front of a cottage or whatnot--the first and only EG I would drink happily, a tea I went to specific 24/7 restaurants at 2am when needing food just because I could at least count on the tea... well, it's a passing memory, one I have about half a dozen more memories to treasure before parting ways with Numi, probably with an email expressing sadness.I DO overall recommend their teas: The lemon myrtle chamomile, now deceptively called lemon chamomile when it's the FLOWER not the fruit added to lovely organic chamomile, is hopefully still as wonderful, their Moroccan Mint is unsurpassed and the smoothest, sweetest mint imaginable, impossible to oversteep for that matter, able to handle a trio of steepings for that matter [whereas Stash uses PNW mint that is medicinal, which is honestly only good to make yogurt sauce or ... medicine!], and even for the ones like Golden Chai that aren't to MY liking, they're still well made, just not a blend I care for ingredient-wise...I simply can't recommend THIS Numi product anymore (and I hope as I use the last of my others this proves the ONLY one that got \"revamped\" somehow, the \"how\" seemingly the fruit, whether they are doing it faster or using different fruit or outsourcing the bergamot processing or... whatever they changed to make it a stinky-bagged, fruitless flavored, bitter chemical-aftertaste tea). I tasted the new just one night after a week of delighting in their original blend night after night, using my reliable method with precise timing and all, went away from it a full month, and in finding the last half box of the old, decided to compare them to be sure it wasn't simply me being thrown off. It's not. I don't deem it so unworthy that it can't be a pleasant change for the people who benefit from our brunch outreaches geared at homeless populations, and it'll probably be a welcome addition, but I will NOT be drinking the other 51 bags from this purchase myself, not when I have teas I genuinely love (as I did this, which was barely drinkable with a LOT of sugar that rendered it barely-even-tea anymore--before, it was best with a tiny bit of sugar and milk, but it was absolutely palatable with no additions).", "summary": "They ruined their perfect product (the only legit, non-oil-sprayed EG widely available)", "overall": 2.0}

I would not get this drink again, although I may try some of the other drinks from the brand since they are supposed to be pretty good.  Maybe something with a stronger taste than light lemon would be better.My biggest complaint with this drink would be the taste.  I honestly think it tasted like lemon sawdust.  And I'm not sure why it tasted that way.  I don't think it was the stevia, as I've drank things with stevia in it before without this effect, so I'm not sure what to blame.  It had just a little bit of sweetness to go along with the sawdust but there wasn't a very strong taste of anything.  The lemon taste was very faint, and as said before, it was mostly covered by the sawdust taste.The ingredients in this product are good, which kept it from getting one star.  Most everything is organic, and stevia is the sweetener.  A pretty healthy drink in all.  It also had zero calories and zero fat, so its a good diet drink if it was more palatable.  And at 16.9 fl oz, it lasts for a couple of hours (at least for me anyway) when drinking.  The Honest brand also boasts that its gluten free, no GMO's, is recycled, and they plant a tree, so lots of good things going on with the company in general.Not too great, I don't recommend it to anyone.

{"reviewText": "I am not a fan of any drink in an aluminum can containing BPA (bisephenol A - a toxic plastic liner), especially one which is only 70% juice, but I promised to give this \"all natural energy drink\" a try. I chilled it, waited until the inevitable post-lunch lull lay like a siren call on my sagging shoulders, popped the can's top and sat back to enjoy the ride. And to really test the drink's effectiveness I challenged it to help me breeze through e-filing my taxes.Before I began tallying rows of figures until my eyes crossed, I read the fine print on the can that cautions the use of this beverage by pregnant women, children or those sensitive to caffeine. Being an adult female that is not pregnant and a daily drinker of strong tea/coffee, I felt vaguely safe but a bit wary, like I feel sitting in front of my car's air bag. I noted the caffeine content(80 mg) is comparable to that Red Cow drink in the blue and silver can, so I donned my tax matador persona and began plowing through the maze of my 1040 form. I carried the lesser of line 22 (a) or line 24 (d) to the larger of line 47 or line 53, and STILL, no quickening pulse, or lightning bolt of inspiration on how to apply Apathetic Energy Credits to defray the cost of Fido's solar-heated dog house.In short, the energy bump I expected never came, instead I was left with the apple juice, lemon juice & Stevia aftertaste noted by many reviewers. Although Stevia is a healthy sweetener, its taste did not work in this juice. This product is a ill-fated marriage of flavors, calories and a stimulant that should never make it to the altar. The in-laws would never get along.The color of the drink (red) should have helped to balance and ground my root chakra (this would have been a benefit), but I recommend a natural 100% cranberry or cherry juice instead.Thanks for reading!

{"reviewText": "At first this can of Bumble Bee Omega-3 Albacore Tuna appealed to me. I liked the fancy gold tone metal can and the fact that Omega-3 is a very heathy protein that we should all be consuming.That was a rather shallow reason for selecting this tuna as it turns out. I decided to do my own little product test for this review. While shopping at Wegman's supermarket I picked up an on sale can of their store brand albacore tuna. It cost 79 cents. Packed in water.Reading the labels it turns out that each can provided 9 grams of protein. Thus they are equal in Omega-3. The Bumble Bee brand tuna is packed in three different kinds of oil. I am not sure why because those oils do not add to the protein value at all. for those allergic to soy oil there could be a little problem with this brand.Upon opening the cans, I drains the liquids and weighed the tuna. Wegman's weigh slightly more but the can comes in at 6 ounces rather than 5 ounces of Bumble Bee tuna.The quality of the drained tuna in both were what I was judging. Appearance and taste is the best measure of why the Bumble Bee tuna only earned two stars. Tuna packed in water maintains its structure and, in this case, flavor. The Bumble Bee tuna was mushy around the edges and did not hold it's shape when used in a salad. It also tasted like the oil used for packing. The Wegman store brand tuna came out of the can as a solid, firm, easily flaked fillet of white tuna. And it tasted mild and delicious while keeping its forkful shape in the salad.Higher cost is another issue, but misleading advertising indicating that their tuna packed in these oils provides more Omega-3 protein than a plain store brand tuna is the primary negative one for me.Although that gold can still has flashy charm!", "summary": "A misleading way to sell oily tuna", "overall": 2.0}

When you get the pod loaded and the coffee is flowing it looks promising.  It looks and smell richer than regular k-cups.  However, when you taste it that all falls apart.  This is by far the weakest k-cup coffee I've ever had.  There is little to no coffee flavor at all.  It's just colored water.  For comparison, Kirkland Signature Breakfast Blend sold at costco is a pretty weak light roast k-cup offering.  This Melitta has about a quarter the flavor of those.  My thoughts on why are actually this redesigned pod.  You see once you take the pod out of the wrapper its a light plastic \"skeleton\" that holds a filter like paper liner holding the coffee grounds.  K-cup coffee itself is already processed in such a way that the coffee is weaker than fresh grounds.  Adding an extra paper filter to that makes for an incredibly weak cup of coffee.

Chicken soup never did me any harm, I guess -- but I can't remember it curing anything, either.  Though not my favourite soup, I never really disliked it.  OK....My mother makes a clear soup.  Soak the chicken, and vegetables, under a low light, in a covered pot, for hours.  Then, take the fat off with a ladel.  Remove the chicken and vegetables, and serve on a separate platter, (so that just the right amount of chicken stock and vegetables go into each person's soup...or none at all, if desired.)Not bad!My own way of making chicken soup is a little simpler.  Take chicken meat, (breat, dark meat from the legs, whatever you wish), and cut into small pieces, (the smaller, the better.)  Place 1/2 milk, half-water mixture in blender, and slowly add chicken pieces, and mixed vegetables and spices if you wish.  After a few minutes, you have a nicely PUREED chicken soup.  Also not bad.However, CAMPELL'S HEALTHY REQUEST CREAM OF CHICKEN SOUP, which I bought to save refrigerator space, (chicken parts have to be refrigerated, this soup does not) -- doesn't taste good, (OR like either my mom's chicken soup, or my own).  I suppose this is because \"modified food starch\", (the second ingredient in this Campbell's soup), was never used by either my mother or myself in OURchicken soups.  (Has ANYONE ever added modified food starch to their home-made chicken soups, I wonder?).  Yes, there are tiny bits of chicken meat in this soup, (fourth ingredient, after chicken stock, modeified food starch, and water)...but very little of these.  Most ofthe ingredients come under the heading: Less than 2% of\", but I begin to wonder if the \"chicken meat\" contained in the first section of ingredients, (those above 2%), may be like only 3% or so!  In the \"2% or less\" category are listed both \"salt\" and \"sea salt\"....making for perhaps 4% salt, in toto.  This is supposed to be a \"low-sodium\" soup -- but is 410 mgs of salt, (17% of Daily Value), actually a \"low sodium\" soup?  Pehaps, compared to the regular Campbell's soup, (listed at 840 mgs on the label), it is.  But NO-ONE I ever knew puts even 410 mgs of salt into any home-made soup.  A preservative?  Yes.  But still too much salt for my taste.  VITAMIN E is also a preservative -- and a much healthier one at that.  More expensive -- definiely yes.  But it would make the soup far more palatable to have 1/2 the salt, (205 mgs), and then adding a little Vitamin E!  All I know is that this abundance of salt adds not only somewhat of a danger to my heart, but also a slightly sour taste to this soup.  Making it taste, not only sour, but also so very, very UNLIKE the chicken soup I either my mom or I make.Perhaps the regular, Non-Healthy Request Chicken Soup by Campbell's is better.  I'll get one or two cans from my local supermarket and see, before I buy 24 via Amazon, (which is what I should have done, before buying this \"Healthy Request\" Campbell's soup.)  Truly, I like their Heathy Request Mushroom and Celery Soups, and don't find their Healthy Request Tomato Soup half-bad.  But one can't judge every Campbell's soup by the ones that one likes, it seems.  This cicken soup is just too salty and too soury for me ever to buy it again.  But it is palatable...JUST palatable.

Certainly, I cannot taste any Parmesan cheese.The product page suggests that this product works with chicken pieces or pork.  I'm here to say that you should be aware that whatever goes into this \"roasting\" bag will be steamed and eventually boiled, and definitely not roasted and not caramelized.  So choose your cut of chicken or pork carefully, while keeping that in mind. And remove every morsel of fat before it goes in the bag.In other words, if you use skin-on chicken pieces you might just be turned off chicken skin for life.  Seriously...And maybe that is a plus--at least for me.  For a long time, I've been trying to convince myself that I don't need to eat that beautifully browned and juicy and crisp chicken skin from my roasted chicken.  Now, after eating one of the chicken thighs steamed in this bag, I won't be eating chicken again for a while, and I will think twice, maybe three times, before I eat the skin--no matter how crispy it is.Maybe boneless, skinless breast meat is the only viable alternative in this case. And that might be fine for you.  Add a few sprigs of rosemary and maybe a few chopped veggies, then de-fat the juice and sprinkle on some real Parmesan when the chicken gets to the serving platter and you might just have something your family will love.  Or maybe dab some Dijon mustard on the chicken before it goes in the bag.  This product does need \"help\" to taste good.It cleans up nicely.  And it's a quick meal, but then chicken breasts always are.I'll never give this product another chance.  Give me a whole chicken, let me dust it with fine sea salt and toss it on the gas grill over indirect heat.  My chicken--and my meal--will be perfect and I'll be serving within an hour.", "summary": "Not roasted, but steamed chicken pieces", "overall": 2.0}

I've been using the ekobrew cupsEkobrew Cup, Refillable Cup for Keurig K-cup Brewer, Brown 2-countsince I first started using my Keurig, and I've been quite happy with the result.  They're still going strong, clean up easily, etc.So, when offered the opportunity to try these Melitta E-Filter Reusable K-Cups, I figured I give them a shot.Actually, I gave them 10 shots.  The score: 0 for 10.  I NEVER got a decent cup of coffee from them.  In every case, the coffee came out weak, more like coffee-flavored tea.A little background:  I like my coffee \"robust,\" but not so strong that it practically walks out the door by itself.  I use the \"middle\" (7.25 oz) brew size on my Keurig Platinum, and it consistantly produces good results for me no matter what coffee I use.  I grind my beans just a bit finer than if I were using a traditional \"drip\" system and I get a great cup of coffee.For my trial run with the Melitta E-Filter cups, I used the same coffee I've been using with the ekobrew cups, same grind, etc.  My first attempt, I just spooned the coffee into the Melitta cup per instructions, just up to the lip, snapped the lid shut and dropped it into the Keurig on the same setting I use every day.Out came -- well, it wasn't coffee, that's for sure.  Pale, caramel-colored water.  OK, so maybe I didn't put enough coffee into the cup.Second try: spooned in the coffee and packed it as I added it, up to the lip, snapped the lid shut, and dropped it into the machine.  Out came -- slightly better, but still not even close to \"real\" coffee.OK, so maybe the brew setting needs to be adjusted.  Dropped it down to the \"small cup\" setting (5.25 oz).  Filled another Melitta cup, into the Keurig, and ... nada.  Still nothing like decent coffee.Tried several other coffees, tried it with the extra-small cup setting, still no luck.  After 10 tries, I gave up.I really wanted to like these; they're less expensive than the ekobrew cups (which I know will need to be replaced eventually, but after 5 months of use, still show no signs of wear), etc.  But if they can't produce a drinkable cup of coffee, what's the point?", "summary": "Not nearly as good as other reusable K-cups ...", "overall": 2.0}

Caffeine itself is a stimulant drug that stimulates the metabolism and nervous systems of the body.  Since many of us drink coffee for the same effects, I was very curious to see if drinking Vitality Avitae Caffeinated Water could keep me off that black morning beverage.After opening the expertly packaged and shipped box from Amazon, my initial impressions of this energy inducing product from Vitality were very strong.  The cone shaped bottle is a little taller than a plastic soda pop container but much slimmer.  The silver gradient coloring on the Avitae package is actually a thin plastic wrapper that has been affixed to the bottle.My tiny first sip of cold Avitae Caffeinated Water was quite refreshing.  The water initially has a pure, clean taste that my tongue loved.  However, an after taste came on strong after just a second later.  The sensation reminded me of what you would expect from chewing an Aspirin tablet.  Obviously, you would not willingly chew up aspirin, just to avoid that flavor!An hour later, the 90mg of Caffeine did kick in for me.  Not really any faster than a standard cup of Kicking Horse Coffee Kick Ass Dark but it still worked.In conclusion, the strange after taste of this beverage product deeply affected my opinion of it.  I like this product because of the simple ingredients list:  water and caffeine.  Yet, the lack of any other flavor was a bad choice because not many people will consume this product.  If you still wish to have a caffeine rush from your daily dose of water, I suggest Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink for its B12 and C content that really offer a serious kick of energy plus mask the drug flavor with Fruit Punch!", "summary": "Ask Yourself, How Would 90mg Of Caffeine Taste In Purified Water?", "overall": 2.0}

It's more similar to the Green & Black (which I didn't have with me to compare while eating the Scharffen Berger so I don't entirely recall). It ends up just making the chocolate feel gritty in my mouth.My next impression is that the bar itself is significantly thinner than other bars, which gives it a softer, smoother texture, but ultimately just ends up emphasizing the gritty texture of the coffee.I also felt like the chocolate itself was a little bit sweet which I attributed to it being a 62% versus the 72% of the Endangered Species. However, the Chocolove is a 55%, which should be too sweet for me, but that chocoloate holds up much better and seems smoother than the Scharffen Berger.My final issue with the Scharffen Berger is that it has a lingering, bitter after-taste that I don't get with the other bars, providing a less-than-satisfying experience that makes me want to go eat or drink something else.Overall, I think the Chocolove and Endangered Species coffee and/or espresso chocolate bars are far superior.", "summary": "Gritty texture, not satisfying", "overall": 2.0}

I love the idea and certainly hope more people will look at alternatives to the expensive, non-recyclable K-cups. Melitta is almost there.I got the Melitta to compare it to my Ekobrew since I've been unable to find them locally and the price through Amazon is double what I paid locally for the one I do have. Melitta seems too flimsy though. You have three main parts. There's a plastic frame for the paper filter, the plastic cup that fits around the frame, and then a snap-on lid. To use it, you place the frame upside down on the counter, place the paper filter over it, make sure it's even or you get gaps that the coffee will leak out of, and then push the plastic up over it. Fill it with coffee, snap the lid on, and you're ready to brew. The outer cup seems sturdy, but that plastic frame bends easily, so I'm afraid it's going to break after repeated use.My first attempt led to leaking grounds, so I had to try again. This time it was better, but it seemed like such a fuss to get the filter positioned correct, that I felt like I'd wasted time. Subsequent uses made it easier to know exactly how to line up the paper filter correctly, so I think it's a learning process.Now that I've used it consistently for a few days, I am pleased with what it does, but hands down, the Ekobrew is so much easier to use, and I'm not throwing away a little paper filter in the end. The paper filters are the other issue I have.I called around to local stores where I usually buy coffee filters and none of them have the Javajig filters. Most of them had never even heard of them. That means when I need more, I'm going to have to order them online or make my own from normal coffee filters. Amazon is currently sold out, so I can't see what their shipping would be. You can order the filters directly through Melitta for $3.99 a box and then $6.99 for shipping and handling.

Sadly, this was not the case.I first ate this as a dry snack in the afternoon. From the picture on the box, I thought the cereal pieces would be bigger. They were slightly more crumbly than a normal chocolate cereal. Then I bit into them and couldn't find the chocolate filling. I broke several apart and found a hollow space for the filling but found nothing. After munching on a couple handfuls I thought I detected a filling. I broke another piece open and found this super faint layer of chocolate inside the piece. Here I was expecting a nice blast of chocolate and got a super light hint. They were also gritty. The only thing I can think of is that is from the whole grains.When I had them with milk, I was not impressed. The first thing I notice is it felt like eating super puffed up dirt.

{"reviewText": "I've kept a bottle of Tabasco (the original blend) in my kitchen for more decades than I care to admit. I've added a few drops to any number of dishes that I wanted to \"kick up\" a notch and used it regularly in a Bloody/Virgin Mary.I'm embarrassed to say I never experimented with any other brand of hot sauce until recently.After taste testing over 40 different hot sauces (everyone needs a hobby), writing up notes, test tasting them blind again - writing up new notes and then comparing my old notes versus new notes ----- I have to say Tabasco's original blend turns out to be one of the worse hot sauces I have tested blind.Tabasco's original has only two tastes: hot peppers combined with a very heavy dose of vinegar. The bitter vinegar after-taste, so typical in Tabasco's original, is not an inherent quality of a good hot sauce.I could provide an extensive list of hot sauces that are far superior to Tabasco's original but here are just a few that are widely available: I encourage you to try any or all of them. I'm quite certain you will be pleasantly surprised.1) Huy Fong Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce (as potent as Tabasco) but with far less vinegar but a hint of sugar and garlic. Top rated by many.2) Cholula Hot Sauce (milder and less vinegar) - often highly rated by professional reviewers3) Tapatio Salsa Picante Hot Sauce (milder and with less vinegar)4) Huichol Hot Sauce (milder - less vinegar - not so widely available)5) Tabasco's own Chipotle blend (much milder - rich tasting featuring the chipotle smoked pepper -less vinegar)I hope I've encouraged everyone to try a few other hot sauces beyond this onePS: Once you get away from Tabasco's (original) hot sauce and what I find to be its excessive vinegar after-taste you open up a whole new world. There are so many superior hot sauces available that it is almost impossible to comprehend. Things have certainly improved since the late 1800s when Tabasco first came to market. While Tabasco likes to brag that this is their original blend ---- that is not a \"plus\" in my view but rather a \"minus\" - a marketing gimmick where they argue that an inherent flaw (a lot of vinegar) is an attribute. BTW: Less anyone think I have an axe to grind with Tabasco - see my review of Tabasco's Chipotle hot sauce which I rated as excellent!What more can I say - experiment - I sincerely doubt you will stick with Tabasco's original hot sauce after trying a few other brands.UPDATE ----- A PROFESSIONAL REVIEW of Hot Sauces has come out: While my original review was written over a year prior - just recently America's Test Kitchen, a show on PBS, TESTED a number of HOT SAUCES.What sauce came in FIRST? ------ Huy Fong Sriracha.What sauce came in very LAST? ---- TabascoI'll admit it is nice to have a professional tasting panel come to the very same conclusions I arrived at a year earlier.Tastes vary and Tabasco will suit those who like a lot of vinegar in their hot sauce.", "summary": "Well know but FAR from the best.

{"reviewText": "I really didn't want to believe it to be true, but I have objectively determined that it is.  These K-Cups are clogging my Keurig (Platinum B70).I have only tried the Costa Rican variety, and unlike some reviewers, the flavor of this K-Cup is exactly what I wanted.  That makes it only that much harder to abandon them.  Naturally, I've only made matters worse by ordering a second box of 48 of these a mere 10 days after placing the first order for same, because I enjoyed drinking the coffee so much.I'd been searching for a Costa Rican K-cup that might contain coffee from a specific estate, La Minita, and upon my first sip of the brew made from Brown Gold Costa Rican K-cup, I knew I'd finally hit pay dirt.Years ago, when I lived in a city known for its coffee (and for letting the good times roll), I discovered the difference in flavor imparted by the use of La Minita beans quite by accident.  I'd been buying whole beans at a well known coffee house and knew that I preferred this specific bean.  One day, I found them to be out of stock and asked after their disposition.The, \"manager,\" (whom I later suspected to be the franchise owner or at least much more than just that store's manager) came out from the back and asked me why I enjoyed La Minita coffee so much, especially since the state is known for its own high quality locally grown beans.  He appeared dumbfounded when I answered, \"it just tastes cleaner to me.\"Turns out, as he relayed, that he'd been to the estate in Costa Rica when negotiating a deal with this then small business and witnessed the processing method, as he had at numerous other bean producers' plants.  The process utilized was actually unique (at that time, which must have been mid 1990s) in that this was the only grower he'd seen wash the beans.  He was quite shocked that I seemed able to taste the difference having no dirt in my coffee could make.  Needless to say, instead of just ordering some of those beans that he'd planned to discontinue offering just for me, he decided right then and there to begin restocking them for the store.I'm guessing that in this day and age of coffee connoisseurism and also the recent focus on organic growing and elimination of additives (such as fertilizer by products and whatnot), that my favorite estate owner is no longer the only one washing his beans prior to processing them, but additionally, that estate does produce a superior bean to my taste buds. I'm also fairly convinced that the Brown Gold Costa Rican K-cup utilizes my favorite beans as the once small estate owner now seems to be the main coffee grower for the region according to my internet research.And that, my fellow shopper, is why this K-cup gets two stars instead of one.  I like the flavor, and this coffee is low in acidity with a nice smooth finish that some drinkers equate with weakness of the brew (I do not).  To me, a coffee doesn't have to be bitter to deliver a potent caffeine pick-me-up.  Of course, I cannot speak to the other varieties of Brown Gold as I've only tried the Costa Rican one.Every single time I use these, my Keurig gets clogged, and I am forced to stick a wire through the holder assembly to restore water flow.  Sometimes it takes more than one brew using this brand, and other times it happens after only one cup.I bought 96 of these in late August.  When my brewer was clogged early in September, I entertained the notion that it was these that had been the offender, but didn't really want to believe that.  I did put them aside, though, and move on to other brands, includingVan Houtte Costa Rica Coffee Keurig K-Cups, 18 CountandCopper Moon Aroma-Cup, Costa Rican, 12 Count, neither of which seem to cause an immediate clog, and countless non-Costa Rican varieties.  Recently, these were unearthed, and after some more objective testing, I have determined that my clogging problem only arises after using this brand of K-cup.Bottom line :  great tasting cup of coffee, but necessitates far too much brewer maintenance and causes concern over potential to damage the machine.", "summary": "Keurig-Klogging K-Cups", "overall": 2.0}

It all sounded good to me & I enjoyed using it. Over the yrs I was happy to see more & more pre-packaged foods being sweetened with Splenda (or sucralose) instead of aspartame (NutraSweet) or other chemical sweeteners like Sweet n' Low.My happy use of Splenda came to an abrupt halt when I learned that Splenda, which is made of natural sugar that is chemically altered to not be absorbed by the body (hence making it calorie-free) through chlorinization. Chlorine is a thyroid function inhibitor or disruptor. Low thyroid problems already run in my family & I had long been having chronic symptoms of thyroid deficiency despite my blood test numbers being in the \"normal\" range (hence my MD would not treat it). Little did I know I was further harming my already vulnerable thyroid with Splenda! I literally used it daily for 10 straight years. I used to think that Splenda seemed too good to be true & unfortunately for me that's how it turned out. I have since switched to liquid stevia from the healthfood store to sweeten my decaf & not only am I taking nutritional precautions to care for my thyroid but am also on thyroid medication as well (Armour Thyroid by prescription). My low-thyroid symptoms are unrelenting, especially cold intolerance, low energy, quick fatigue, & loss of outer eyebrows.I loved Splenda while I was ignorant of its potential negative effects. For people who don't have thyroid issues, I wouldn't say this is a bad product, & I'd still say it's better than consuming sugar which is the worse evil in my opinion. But for thyroid conditions, I recommend staying away from Splenda/sucralose. It's bad enough we have chlorinated city water to drink (please use a water filter system or pitcher like Brita).

There is clearly money to be made here, so every company under the sun has their own brand, replete with flashy packaging and a mad-scientist assortment of ingredients. No Fear Super Energy Supplement drink is just such a drink. The cool black can with the menacing skull and bold lettering are alluring, likely to attract many. Tread cautiously, dear energy drink consumers.The aforementioned flashy labeling atop the can highlights ingredients such as Taurine, Arginine and L-Carnitine, which are all great components of a good energy drink, but the quantity included in this beverage are so minimal that their impact is likely negligible. And caffeine? 85mg per serving. Slightly higher than a cup of green tea. Basically, every ingredient falls far short of being able to have any real impact -- other than the sugar.

{"reviewText": "We've so far used three different non-organic formulas that work fine and baby likes: Enfamil, Kirkland, and Bright Beginnings. We also tried the Vermont Organic soy-based, which was a total no-go: it smelled odd and the baby simply refused to drink it.This variant works fine, and it's nice that it's certified organic... but you do pay a premium for that label. At present, this is fully three times the cost of Kirkland formula, and that stuff is really not bad. I'm not sure if that extra cost is really worth it for what you get. Then again, I'm also not into the 'everything must be organic' thing as far as food in general goes; if you're one of those people then you'll be very familiar with paying a premium to get the stamp.Edit 2/16/14: After some use, we've found that this formula can't be taken on its own with our baby. If so it tends to cause constipation- something she's never had with any other formula. We actually had to take her to see the pediatrician and use glycerin suppository. It has to be mixed with another formula or only used occasionally to avoid this. I understand that all babies are different and perhaps it has to do with her age (3 months) but we followed the directions and this is supposed to be for 0-12 months. Needless to say, constipation is nasty to deal with both for us and the little one, so this is a no-go for us as a primary formula.I have read that soy-based is easier to digest, but as noted previously she simply refused to take the Vermont Organics version. We'll most likely go back to regular non-organic formula as it's cheaper, seems just as nutritious, and doesn't cause any problems.", "summary": "Baby likes it, it's organic, but causes constipation", "overall": 2.0}

{"reviewText": "I tried the sister product, theTaco Bell Jalapeno Saucein August, and wrote a review for it.  Overall, this is a slightly better product, with better color and a better taste making the small difference.As with the jalapeno sauce, this product appears to be trying to cover too many bases.  It's \"sauce,\" which means it could go into anything, in cooking or in serving, so it seems to be landing as both a cooking ingredient and as a table condiment.  And it could go on anything from your breakfast eggs to your mac `n cheez for dinner, which makes it a table condiment for breakfast, lunch, dinner, any time.  And its \"bold,\" the American euphemism for something that's not really spicy, is marginally beyond the typical bland and boring that most Americans rely upon.  It's got the tiniest tinge of spice, but isn't powerful in the least; the taste of this product does not qualify as \"bold.\"  Now, the taste ofCheez-It Hot & Spicy; they got \"bold\" with that one.The bottle's copy says the same as the jalapeno sauce, that it's perfect with \"tacos, Mexican salads and sandwich wraps.\"  In our house it went on pork roast, couscous, green beans, Brussels sprouts, meatloaf, and french fries.  My kids (13 and 15) both liked the sauce and declared it was definitely better than the jalapeno sauce.The basis of this sauce is a mayo/buttermilk dressing-type mixture.  I don't know, but it strikes me that all of the Taco Bell sauces start with the same plain base, and the respective flavors are just dumped in at the factory.  The sauce is not chunky in the slightest, and squeezes right out of the bottle.The pluses in this product are the color and taste.  Where the jalapeno sauce faltered because of an unappetizing color of mayonnaise-off-white with mysterious green flecks, this one's smoky-creamy orange color is far more appealing.  It looks better in the packaging, and it looks much better on the plate and on the food.  The taste also is better. Jalapeno is a very distinctive taste, and those who know it and seek it out want that hard burst of powerful, earthy jalapeno punch, the chipotle taste is one that is more subtle, not nearly as strong, and as such works much better in this sauce.  The taste of this product is slightly smoky, with a good tang--not bold, mind you, and not even close to spicy.The sauce is just a bit too runny, though.  Yeah, it's in a squeeze bottle and it's got to have the right consistency to actually flow out of the packaging, but at the same time, it's a bit too runny when it gets on the plate.  Taco Bell needs to thicken it up just a little bit more to get it to the right consistency.This sauce is not bad; it does not taste bad.  It just doesn't deliver on what I'm looking for when it comes to spicy.  If I were starving on a desert island, I'd slurp this stuff out of the bottle and call it the Food of the Gods.Bottom line: \"Creamy\" this sauce is, but \"bold\" it is not.  Our family knows hot and spicy, and a lame American \"bold\" doesn't cut it for us.  If we want Scoville-graded heat with our food, we'll go for theSriracha,Crystal,Cholula, etc.  If we want creamy, we'll go for the all-American ranch dressing or straight-up mayo, and we'll leave this product on the shelf.", "summary": "Passable Utili-Sauce", "overall": 3.0}

The `crunchiness' really did not distract from the product, as it wasn't `hard' from the sense that one had to force a bit through it - just a little more crunchy that what I was expecting.

I did not try it in the cobbler - and I'm not sure I will.Sun Crystals creamed much better than sugar with butter. The smaller granules take less time to blend well. It also blended well with liquids.The cookies themselves didn't turn out that great, though. For me, they were much too sweet. There was a distinct, slightly bitter aftertaste. I think by using more like a 1/2 or quarter cup, they might have been better. Unfortunately, that batch went to the trash. I'm not sure I want to use the ingredients to try it again.In drinks, it blended well - meaning no crystals remained - but there was still an aftertaste that I just could not stomach.However, this may not be the case for others.

{"reviewText": "For pollen in honey refer to the link provided in the comment section. Buckwheat Honey when raw, has more nutrients since it is unpasteurized and not force filtered, to deliver the highest possible levels of enzymes, vitamins and minerals. Raw honey tastes different than filtered or process honey but more importantly majority of raw honey are in solid form not liquid unless you apply heat or do not store properly. Dutch Gold is not raw, it is filtered and although it tastes like buckwheat since it is from buckwheat flower, an acquired taste, processing takes out the nutrients and that is why it is not in a solid form but liquid form. Dutch Gold is more reputable company than most regardless. Raw Tupelo honey is in liquid form, rare but that is how Tupelo is but Buckwheat in solid form.REAL HONEY: Raw honey is expensive. USDA organic honey is more expensive than just even organic honey without the stamp of USDA. To combine RAW and USDA organic and add qualities like Only 100% pure raw, unpasteurized, unfiltered, undiluted, untreated, unprocessed, no HFCS, not adulterate, not blended with other items such as corn syrup and rice syrup, makes it the true honey not glucose tasting like honey. For that reason that superior product, that superior superfood never sells in big buckets, or hardly ever in any container over 16 oz jar.FILTERING: At country's top honey packers, Dutch Gold, in Lancaster, PA, raw honey gets pumped through layers of white filters. Before the honey hit the filters, a powdered sedimentary rock called diatomaceous earth is added. This is a standard, widely used process. It removes all the pollen, along with dust, bees' wings, and, of course, the diatomaceous earth.ORGANIC HONEY: Organic honey doesn't go through nearly as fine a filter since organic rules prohibit the use of diatomaceous earth in the filtering process but regardless it is not a raw honey just because organic.VARIETY: Weather, location, flower type and season impact the coloring, taste and viscosity of honey produced by bees. Honey by the cost will hardly even crystallize. Tupelo sold by YS is raw although runny and pourable which will not crystallize due to its high moisture content. If from outside of US then Fair Trade stamp has some assurances of fair treatment of workers although not true in every case.CHINESE HONEY: Chinese honey famous for \"ultrapurified,\" a technique that can involve diluting honey with extra water, running it through extremely fine filters, and then removing the water. The process filters out much more and produces a sweet substance that is no longer honey. The process removes any pollens and the possibility of identifying the source of honey. Chinese honey is barred from the U.S. not because it's unsafe, but because U.S. officials decided it was too cheap. Chinese honey has had more than its share of safety problems. But there's also plenty of perfectly good Chinese honey for sale on the world market. EU is fussier about honey quality than the US, yet EU imports lots of honey from China but not US.QUALITY: A honey is only as good as the producer and regardless of all marketing and claims by sellers, there is no assurance that a jar of honey is full of pollen, unheated or unfiltered at 100 degree instead of 130 degree. Even if the honey was heated only to 90 degree at the time of production, the honey jar could be sitting in a storage or while being transported in containers that the temperatures can easily exceed 100 degrees. The only assurance that I have is purchasing honey from a producer with high quality reputation and a seller with high turnover. Wedderspoon brand and New Zealand are on top of my list. Purchasing Wedderspoon directly from Wedderspoon or authorized distributor is the only assurance I have for proper storage, pollen and enzymes that honey is consumed for.USES: I consume honey not by labeling but by the amount of pollen it carries. Only 100% pure raw, unpasteurized, unfiltered, undiluted, untreated, unprocessed, no HFCS, not adulterate, not blended with other items such as corn syrup and rice syrup from only trusted brands. I consume honey all the time since it has many nutritional benefits for me. I consume after any meal since it helps digestion. I used to consume chocolate years ago but I do not anymore since I consume pure cocoa which I add to my power drinks. I am into many sports and quality honey is the best quick energy I can get to boost my immune system and give myself a healthy rush of energy when I am in middle of my mountain biking, hiking, backpacking, surfing, etc. I drink lots of tea and I never use honey instead I use molasses. Molasses does not lose its nutritional value when heated but any heat to raw honey kills the quality enzymes and pollen in honey so I only consume honey straight out of the jar with spoon in moderation due to its high calories. Honey is the best ointment for all my scabs in mountain biking trails. After a day when my wounds are sealed I place raw honey for rejuvenation and it is the best healer of all instead of using Neosporin which loosens the scab and removes the scab, leaving scars on my skin. Honey helps kill the bacteria that may cause infection. When honey comes into contact with damaged skin, it triggers the production of antibacterial hydrogen peroxide. Furthermore, the sugars in honey mean there is little space for water molecules (bacteria need water to survive, so reducing the amount available makes it hard for them to thrive). Dabbing on honey or a sprinkling of sugar can deprive the bacteria of water, which ultimately destroys them. Bravo.", "summary": "Filtered Buckwheat...", "overall": 3.0}

{"reviewText": "Sometimes, you think, plain water is boring--especially when you know that you need to drink several glasses of it every day.  Having a product that gives a pleasant taste to water seems like a great idea.  Somewhere between the execution of that great idea and the actual Mio product, is reality.We all perceive tastes and smells differently, having thousands of receptors in our mouths, noses, and on our tongues.  Our enjoyment or dislike of a product varies, based on those receptors.  Remember too, that we `eat with our eyes' before we taste anything.Using  teaspoon of the concentrate in eight ounces of water (very cold with ice), here are my impressions of this water enhancer:Eyes:  it looks like a light brown color for tea.  Home-brewed teas (except for white, green or, fruit teas) have a darker color.  This one has a touch of pinkish beige to it.Nose:  It has the scent of a weak tea.Mouth:  the first sensation is sweetness, not at all cloying.  I don't get a strong flavor at all.  I add another half teaspoon.  The color deepens.  Instead of tasting more tea, I get more sweetness, not a bolder tea flavor.  I don't add more drops, as I don't want a sweeter flavor--just a stronger tea taste.  In comparison to a popular brand, to which a small tub of tea powder and artificial sweetener is added, this one is lacking.The container is small enough to slip into a handbag, briefcase or, backpack.  The directions call for a half-teaspoon measurement.  It would be easier to have the liquid dispense in drops that could be squeezed from the bottle so, instead of guessing as to exact measurement, the number of drops would be more precise.If used according to the package's directions, this little vial contains 24 servings.  It's certainly convenient to be able to turn a glass of water--or a bottle--into a tasty beverage.  Amazon offers a four-pack (and a single vial option).  Together, they make 96 flavored glasses of water.  That's a tremendous savings if you were to buy the equivalent in bottles of flavored water.Please note that this product contains sucralose, an artificial sweetener.  It also contains dyes.Since we rely on our own senses to rate taste, you may want to buy the single container and judge it for yourself.", "summary": "So-So", "overall": 3.0}

Granulated onion is listed on the ingredients along with \"spices\", but the onion flavor comes through rather strongly with the salt and the pepper.

The almonds also win with 210 mg of potassium versus only 140 mg in the cashews.In the end, though, the taste is what is going to make or break this product for most people.  What you need to know is that the flavor of these cashews is very strong, and it doesn't come from the cashews themselves.  If a strong salt, pepper, and onion flavor is what you are looking for in a snack, this will be right up your alley.

However, that may just a legal requirement - not sure.Since it's been a few days since I had the last one, I went out and got one that I'm eating while I'm reviewing it.

This is a useful comment, so I am adding it here so that more people see it.)You might be suprised to know that this is a Hershey Bar. They bought the name because Scharffen was a competitor. They don't make the chocolate the way it was made originally by Scharffenberger and Steinberg who were partners. It's a Hershey product now through and through.Historical Info:Hershey purchased Scharffen Berger for about two times the company's annual revenue, which was approximately $10 million a year at the time of the 2005 acquisition. The same year Hershey's also bought another San Francisco company, Joseph Schmidt Confections, and combined the two smaller companies into a wholly owned subsidiary, Artisan Confections Company. In 2006 Hershey's purchased Dagoba, an Ashland, Oregon-based manufacturer of organic chocolate. Hershey's subsequently began manufacturing its new artisan brands in a factory in Robinson, Illinois and in early 2009 announced plans to close both Bay Area factories, lay off approximately 150 local employees, and transfer remaining production to Illinois, effectively keeping the company, Scharffen Berger, alive in name only.

Sunflower lecithin is a fatty oil derivative used as an emulsifier or anti-stick compound.  Not crazy about it being in here, but it must be in a tiny amount to not affect the fat level.  Natural flavor is another questionable ingredient since it can be pretty much anything.  I expect it would be a vanilla extract type ingredient.  But oddly no actual vanilla.  From Wikipedia: \"Synthetic vanillin, instead of natural vanilla extract, is sometimes used as a flavoring agent in foods, beverages, and pharmaceuticals.\"  So that is what I assume the natural flavor ingredient is.  It sounds better than 'synthetic vanillin'.  Which, oddly enough, is allowed in most wines.The tea is a little sweet tasting on the palate.  Mostly vanilla and rose hips in my opinion.  The fruit seemed to be lost a little under the vanilla.  But it is a pleasant flavor.  Also this is an herbal tea so it is naturally caffeine free.  No tea leaves, no rooibos; just the flowers and fruit and the 'flavor' and lecithin.I prefer herbal tea without extra 'filler', so I am not too crazy about these.  A lot of herbal tea brands on the market have good ingredient lists without those two extras.  But it's a good value, and the amount of those substances is small.  Plus, it's not like either ingredient has been proven bad for health or anything.  Just be aware there is a minor amount of processing.I probably won't buy it again, just because I don't think the flavor is very good.  It's not really subtle, it's a little too sweet, and the vanilla and rose hips pretty much overpower the fruit.  Go with Stash Tea or Tazo Tea for better quality and more balanced flavor profiles.  But on a positive note, the bag shape is a novel idea (though it really doesn't make a difference in the end - it's pretty much a marketing gimmick - even flat bags are the same as long as they have room for the tea to expand in liquid).For a better Lipton herbal try this:Lipton Herbal Pyramid Tea Bags, Orange Blossom Hibiscus, 18Count (Pack of 6)/Lipton Herbal Orange Blossom Hibiscus Pyramid Tea Bags 1.1 oz", "summary": "Oddly no vanilla in the ingredients for a blackberry vanilla tea...", "overall": 3.0}

The other cobbler turned out well enough but a bit crumbly and a little dry tasting, and this one is spoonful dropped over the fruit and baked.I think this flour blend will fall into a hit-n-miss category when baking.

I give them a thumbs up for noting this in a few places on the package as opposed to other companies who simply ignore our country of origin labeling laws.Compared to other brands, the original flavor is milder with less flavoring.  The taste of soy is stronger and there is less taste of sweet or smoke.  I'd rank the overall flavor and texture in the middle of the pack. The meat is tender but not so much that you wonder what they're doing to it.  If you're not subject to at least some toughness, you better examine the ingredient label.  At least it's not the pressed and formed ground meat chunks that some brands try to pass off as beef jerky.I'm taking off a couple stars because 1) they use MSG which is the cheater's way of making jerky as all it does is excite your taste buds, 2) the price is decent but doesn't scream \"buy now\" and, 3) it contains propylene glycol like my deodorant.

{"reviewText": "The late Albert Einstein supposedly once said: \"The definition of 'insanity' is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.\" I must be insane, then, because, thanks to the Amazon Vine program, I keep trying food products that I otherwise would never touch with a 10-foot pole, and I keep expecting them to taste differently than they do.A case in point is Side Mates Quinoa with Rice, Black Beans and Corn. Yes, it's convenient--the sturdy, easy-open packet contains everything. Preparation is very simple. Boil some water, add a little butter or olive oil if you like, dump in the packet of dry ingredients and simmer it for 10 to 12 minutes, until white, spiral threads appear around each quinoa grain. In our case, we had to simmer it for a little longer, because we live at an altitude of 4,600 feet above sea level and water boils at a lower temperature. After all the water is absorbed, you have a one-pot side dish.Quinoa is an interesting grain that imparts to this Side Mate a slightly different, more robust and chewy texture than you might expect from this type of dish. But it is also relatively tasteless. I'm sure the Serrano peppers, roasted Hatch green chiles andDouble Bastard Double Burn Haba&ntilde;ero Hot Saucethat my wife and I add to virtually every meal, along with the huge doses of hops in the Imperial I.P.A. and Imperial Stout beers that we usually drink, have destroyed our taste buds. Thus you may want to ignore my opinion that Side Mates Quinoa with Rice, Black Beans and Corn is bland. In fact, at least one other reviewer here says it's too spicy for her to eat more than a couple of bites (in fairness, ancho chile is listed as an ingredient). For what it's worth, I didn't taste any heat in it at all. None. Zero. Instead, I thought I had a mouthful of Styrofoam until I augmented it with additional flavor elements. It may align well with normal American tastes, but, unless you kick it up a few notches, it has little to offer those who prefer lots of flavor. Also, there are very, very few black beans and corn kernels in the product. You might find a couple of each in a hearty forkful, but no more than that. The quinoa and rice definitely dominate.If you want to try something a little different, or if you're not familiar with quinoa and want to sample it without preparing it from scratch, then Side Mates Quinoa with Rice, Black Beans and Corn might be just the thing for you. Just be prepared to throw in a lot of extras--garlic, scallions and a few spices would be good, in addition to chiles and hot sauce--in order to get a tasty side dish.", "summary": "Typical \"Add to Water and Boil\" Product--No Better, No Worse", "overall": 3.0}

It's so strange to me - first of all this drink comes in the same little square paper boxes that the individually packaged Silk Soymilk comes in.  These have far less flavor and I can't imagine how they could be better for a child then either real milk or soymilk.As far as flavor goes - my husband thought they tasted chalky, like the powder wasn't dissolved.  The kids said they tasted like \"nilla wafers\" I thought it tasted like super sweet vanilla flavored water.  Speaking of which - if you look at the first two ingredients they are \"Water, Sugar\" I don't know why a drink marketed as \"Nutritionally Complete\" with the words \"Immunity protection\" in bold colors is basically sugar water with some vitamins added in.  True it's lactose free and has no high fructose corn syrup - but wouldn't soymilk be healthier then sugar water?  I know it sure tastes better then this stuff.On to the highly touted straw (they make big claims about this \"Probiotic\" straw) it's the same freakin straw on the Silk soymilk boxes so it's certainly not new as far as shape goes.  What is new is the industrial packaging of the straw that required scissors to open.  Neither of my kids could get the straw out of the packaging without scissors.  This means sending one in the school lunch is not an option.  Now the box says that the straw increases a kid's immunity - I'm not sure how that works, though the straw does have two ingredients - Canola oil, L reuteri Protectis.  After looking it up I discovered that L Reuteri Protectis is a bacteria that is supposed to live in human intestines to help with preventing diarrhea.  So basically it's a bacteria covered straw - just good bacteria.What actually weirded me out in regards to this drink was not so much the drink itself - but the printed material on the box - words like \"Use under medical supervision\" and \"Talk to your pediatrician.\"  Those things throw up a red flag for me.  I guess if your kid is home sick with diarrhea or vomiting then this would probably be good for keeping their fluids up and some nutrients in their bodies - I just don't see the point in every day consumption if you are already feeding your kid healthy food.

I was delighted by the hot pink foamy action at the top of the glass, but after stirring it around with a spoon, the foam quickly disappeared and the powder all dissolved into the water.On the plus side, the powder all dissolves.  There is no junk left at the bottom of the glass.  The color is very bright pink - almost fuchsia.  It seems a little artificial to me, but I'm not sure if it's a natural color for the pomegranate.

Manuka honey is supposed to have antibacterial activity, which regular honey has anyway. It also is supposed to have other properties that tea tree oil has since those are the flowers that the bees feed on. The idea is that the honey can be used to treat internally through digestion and with topical application. I have found many claims on the internet with all the things this is supposed to help or cure but I really have not found significant proof.This honey is thicker and seems unfiltered, something that I'm not used to seeing since I buy my honey through the grocery stores. But having worked in an apiary, I know it's from the pollen. It's nothing bad; I've seen a crazy where the pollen was supposed to be good for you too. It's just not something that is common.This honey also had a deeper flavor to it. It didn't seem as sweet at clover honey. It was more of an earthy flavor. I also found a little bit did the trick where normally I would be using more clover honey for the same results.I am torn on the price which at this time is $17 for just over 8 ounces of honey. I understand that this is a specialized honey and will get a higher price. But I have to ask myself if it is because of the specialized honey or the new honey antibacterial property crazy that seems to follow Manuka honey.In the end, I think this is a personal choice. If someone is looking for the specialized honey for both the antibacterial properties and the rare flavor, then I can see this being something that would be highly desired.

This is a decent snack size as an addition to a packed lunch or as a quick nibble between meals.

The cup and the lid are both recyclable.There are other snack foods now being packaged in this format. It has some advantages over the usual plastic snack bag packaging.  Of course, there's always the option of buying said snacks in a regular box and getting some kind of reusable container to make up your own snack packs as desired.  It's up to you to decide if the convenience factor outweighs the cost and the amount of trash you end up with. The math is telling.As of August 2013, a quick check of a local supermarket shows a 14 ounce box of Cheez-It crackers priced at $2.99, versus $13.85 for 22 ounces of crackers spread across a pack of 10 cups plus shipping from Amazon.

{"reviewText": "I have alwlays savored a good cup of coffee. Prior to getting my Keurig, I would hunt down beans, grind them and brew them. But the Keurig can't be beat for convenience. The only downside is the ridiculously expensive K-cups. I do get mine from online sites such as 11th street coffee and occasionally at Bed Bath and Beyond when i have thier ubiquitous 20% off coupon.  A do it yourself K-cup seemed like a great idea. Unfortunately, this one did not work as well as expected.I did like that there are two cups. I was planning to reserve one for coffee and one for tea. Set up is easy and well illustrated on the box.  In explicably,the recommendation that you use an expresso grind is embossed on the black cap. It is hard to read and really,  couldn't this info been put on the box? Essentially you slide one of the disposable paper filters over the the black filter insert and then slip the green up over the paper filter.  You fill the cup with your tea or coffee and put the cap on. (Again, there is no guage of how much coffee to add.again, a suggestion on the box would have been appreciated.) Although the directions say to \"snap\" it on, it does not snap. It just lies on top. After brewing, you toss the paper filter and rinse the cup, insert and cap. Unfortunately, my machine, which is an older model, punched a hole through the filter resulting in a grounds filled, weak cup of coffee. (Again, while the box says it can be used with most Keurigs, it would have been helpful to include a list.)  I tried again, using two paper filters and less coffee.That resulted in fewer grounds in the coffee, but the brew itself was watery and weak. I see that some reviewers more determined than I performed surgery on the legs of the insert. Frankly, I have neither the inclination nor the energy to go that far. For something that was supposed to make my life easier, it has not. I hadn't bargained on fooling with filters and snipping the insert all for a less than satisfactory cup of joe.While I applaud the concept and think the name is cute, the actual execution leaves alot to be desired.", "summary": "Not Doing the Happy Dance", "overall": 3.0}

My first impression was the aroma of the coffee upon opening the package - very nice vanilla aroma, but strong. When I made my first pot of coffee I used the Starbucks Natural Fusions Vanilla alone.  For me, this was a mistake.  WAY too sweet, and I like vanilla flavored creamer in my coffee, but used plain half n' half for this one and it still tasted too sweet to me.The second pot I chose to mix this coffee (50/50) with a Kona blend from the local market.

I can't say I like it, but I don't dislike it either.The packaging says 'an accent of vanilla' and 'an understated vanilla highlight'.  I'd beg to differ.  I'd say something like infused with a 'strong vanilla overtone'.  The ground coffee contains ground vanilla beans and Indian sarsaparilla root.Maybe it's the root that does it?

Also, I am not necessarily sure it is  worth the cost of nearly $1 per can (a small can compared to traditional soda).Bottom line: We have tried other natural sodas that we found better tasting and less expensive. It's not bad, so it might be worth a try to see which of the natural brands your family likes best.

{"reviewText": "If you're looking for crunch, Back To Nature Summer Berry Blend cereal delivers a product with a crunch that can probably be measured on the Richter scale.The flakes are touted as multigrain, but only contain wheat and barley which I found a little disappointing. They are also loaded with brown sugar which is what...supposed to make them more natural? It's still sugar, and at 17g per serving it seems a bit high for something \"100% Natural\". The flakes are somewhat tasty and would probably be nothing more than crunchy cardboard if not for the excessive brown sugar and of course the berries.Dried strawberries, raspberries and blackberries are scattered about in good proportions and have the odd consistency and intensified, sometimes tart flavor common to dried berries in cereal. Some of the berries have pulverized during shipping and handling so that a fine red dust coats the flakes and collects at the bottom of the bag. This berry dust no doubt adds to the flavor of the flakes especially when eaten dry out of the bag as I prefer to do.I realize that the idea here is to offer a product that has no added colors, preservatives, or flavors but as far as cereal goes this product really has very little nutritional value for the calories consumed (210 calories per 1 cup serving). It does offer 5g of dietary fiber, 10% of Vitamin C, 10% of iron, 5% of potassium and a measly 4% of calcium. The box states it contains Vitamin E but does not say how much. Overall, not very high on the nutrition scale.They added vanilla extract (but according to the box they don't consider that an added flavor) so why not add a bit of vitamin fortification to make it a healthier product?If you're looking for a cereal with a high crunch factor, this would qualify, but if you'd like some nutrition to go along with that crunch I would recommend Fiber One Carmel Delight which is not quite as crunchy but it has less calories, less sugar, much more flavor, fiber and nutrition.", "summary": "Loaded with crunch but lacks nutrition", "overall": 3.0}

While the rice/quinoa blend is quite tasty, the product is overpriced given what bulk rice and quinoa cost. Personally, I don't shop organic so any premium for this attribute is something I don't value. What is valued is the speed of preparation. These pouches can be microwaved in 90 seconds. Just rip a small vent, place in the microwave and 90 seconds later, you have a meal. No water is needed.The taste is superior to rice alone in my personal opinion. There is a notable taste difference compared to other rice-dishes, so the added variety could be worth the price premium for individuals who don't have the time cook rice and quinoa conventionally.One of the touted benefits of Quinoa is the protein content.  Yet, this product only has 6 grams of protein for every 240 calorie serving.  This is a lower protein/calorie ratio than whole grain bread.  Protein has four calories per gram, which would mean that 240 calories of pure protein could yield 60 grams of protein.  Realistically, high protein foods would have four to six times as much protein as this product per calorie.If you are looking for a healthy, high carbohydrate snack or small meal, give the Seeds of Change quinoa/rice a shot.

Other than the aftertaste, this tastes pretty good. I can pick out the different flavors of pomegranate, blackberry, honey, and tea, and they don't clash with each other. They're well blended together for the most part and this is pretty awesome with a lot of ice.It's just that the aftertaste ruins it. There's this slight chemical taste to the product that really interferes with the other flavors, making it so I am unable to forget that this is a powdered mix. It isn't something that would keep me from drinking the tea, but with how well everything else works together it's pretty noticeable. Again, this isn't something that I'd say would keep me from going out and purchasing it on my own, just something I hope that Lipton works on in the future.Aside from this, I only had one gripe that did not detract from the product itself and I didn't change the ratings for this at all. I'm just really irritated at the packaging saying that this is a 5 calorie beverage. It is, but only if you plan on using half of the packet. This is something that is standard for most companies and it's really irritating since the majority of consumers will use the entire packet and many will count the entire beverage as 5 calories when it's really 10. It's not as big of a deal here as it is with some of the more sugared products with higher calorie and carb counts, but this is sort of misleading unless you're someone who scours the nutritional and serving information on everything you buy.Overall though, this is something I'd probably go out and buy with my own money.3.4/5", "summary": "Not bad, has a bit of a weird aftertaste, though", "overall": 3.0}

No matter what pan/pot I use, I have to use a cleanser on the top to remove scratches and marks.Included with the kit are the scrubber and 4 packs with 6 refills. Each refill bag is enclosable so they do not dry out. Before use, you place a pad on the scrubber, the pad is already moist (no water needed) and clean the stovetop. I was impressed with the scent but scrubbed and scrubbed and it was not doing much. I found myself using a lot of `elbow grease' and it was not getting better, but worse, the pad was drying out.I then buffed it as stated and it had only cleaned half of the stovetop, if that. It also left a huge film over the ceramic top. I then decided to use what I am used to using, Affresh. I placed my Affresh down and cleaned the burner that was not clean all the way and wiped it clean and it was almost new! It took two products to get it clean when the Affresh has always done the job without much effort.Sadly, I think this is a great idea, the scrubber, refill pads, all in a kit but it does not clean ceramic well at all. My stovetop is black ceramic and it look like it had a white film over all of it after thoroughly wiping it clean.

Within about 15 minutes I didn't feel any obvious energy or anything, but one odd sensation was that my limbs felt a little lighter, like I was buoyed a bit by helium or something.  So I'm guessing I was experiencing some energy boost since I didn't feel as tired.I know some people who get headaches and such from some energy drinks, but I don't get headaches, and with the normal iced tea intake the caffeine wasn't a shock to my system, so I had no abnormal reactions.

{"reviewText": "So, gluten free is becoming the new norm around here.  Many people are indulging in a gluten free lifestyle, some out of necessity and some out of curiosity.  I have friends who do this, and while some of the gluten free products available are palatable, I have found that more often than not they are off putting.  I was excited to see if this `care package' contained any pleasant surprises, but overall it just reaffirmed by previous belief; that gluten free is not for me.Let's take these one at a time.Blueberry Pomegranate Trail Mix Crunch:Flavor-wise, this is pretty good.  There isn't much in the package though, and the clusters are rather large.  They are also very sticky and leave a residue on your fingers.  Like I said, they tasted good (not very strong in the pomegranate flavor, but very nutty and blueberry tasting) but they also had a strong resemblance to `healthy cereal', so keep that in mind before purchasing.Multi-Seed Crackers:Crunchy and satisfying; these crackers taste slightly `healthy' but they also have some interesting flavors that give it a distinct and memorable taste.  I had to get used to them, but after a few bites I was hooked.Steak Nuggets + Cheese:This box contains a little meal.  The beef steak nuggets are a bit like jerky but they have a bland aftertaste.  They are chewy, but predictably so; despite the promise that they are `more tender'.  The Multi-Seed crackers are the same already provided in a larger bag.  When you lather on the Parmesan Peppercorn cheese spread, it takes those crackers to another level.  It's a great flavor, but I will say that it is a tad runny as apposed to creamy.  I'm kind of obsessed with ginger in general, so this Ginger Zip fruit and nut mix is phenomenally good.  I know that seems a tad excessive, but you can't go wrong with banana, cranberries and GINGERED PEANUTS!  Oh, and to finish off the `meal', you have an Almond Roca, which is always delicious.Sheffa Zesty Snack Mix:I was really excited about this.  The mix on the cover of the package looks amazing.  I've had chickpea fries before and I loved them.  Roasted corn and toasted seeds sounded like the perfect way to round out the snack.  Opening the package and peering inside I was turned off completely.  It looked like animal food.  The chickpea noodles are about five times smaller than they appear on the cover.  The taste is also extremely bland and almost too earthy.  It was kind of like chewing on twigs.  I think I've said enough about this one.Popchips, Barbeque Potato:Now these are kind of great.  They have a great airy texture that sits well on the tongue.  The flavor is strong on the outset, but one thing that is a slight detractor is that the flavor does dissipate quickly.  So, yes; the chips aren't perfect, but they are uniquely inviting, and that airy consistency really makes for a light and tangy snack.Sharkies, Watermelon Scream:There is an artificial flavor here that I'm not a gigantic fan of.  It kind of tastes like sugar substitute; a cloyingly sweet aftertaste.  That said, there is a lot of flavor here.  It is a robust flavor, so it has that going for it.  If you don't mind that faux-sugar taste then you should really enjoy these.  I could definitely taste the watermelon, which is nice (I love the flavor).Wild Garden Hummus:On its own, this garbanzo bean dip is a tad too; sweet?  I think that's the sensation I'm getting from this.  It just seems off.  It actually has an almost sour tang to it, like something that has gone bad.  But, when lathered onto one of those multi-seed crackers it is actually masked enough by the earthiness of the cracker to give off a pleasantly balanced bean flavor.Emergen-C Raspberry Fizzy Drink Mix:I love the taste of raspberries, but I have to tell you that I have a strong aversion to these types of drinks.  They always taste chalky and artificial to me and this one really isn't an exception to that rule.  It is void of much flavor, but it certainly smacks the back of your throat with that sweetened fizz.In the end, I can't recommend this to anyone who doesn't need to cut gluten out of their diet.  It just isn't worth it.  But, if you need to find gluten free alternatives to foods you love, then this may be something you'll enjoy.  The Popchips and the crackers are pretty good, and those gingered peanuts are still calling my name.", "summary": "Gluten free alternatives for the `new' lifestyle...", "overall": 3.0}

This is going to get a lot of use in my household.However, the Amazon description as of this writing says organic (which is why I purchased it) but the product I received is not organic. I called Amazon and they expressed concern and said they would fix the listing in 24-48 hours.

However, given the misrepresentation, Amazon gave me a refund worth about 50% of the purchase price. If you buy this, and it is not organic, you should get the same refund. Or a full refund, because they knew about it from my phone call, in no uncertain terms, and they ignored the problem. Either that, or the supplier has actually changed the product to organic, however, personally I wouldn't risk it since it's been an ongoing issue and Amazon hasn't changed it.So here's how I knew: When a product is organic it is labeled \"Certified USDA organic.\" This one is advertised on Amazon as organic, but when the package arrives, it is not labeled organic. That right there was a red flag. The second clue is that as another helpful review points out, Frontier has two labels, the green border and the red border. The red border signifies organic products; the green means the product is conventional. This one is green borderI called Frontier to double check and yes, in fact, the product I received is conventional because it has a green border.I originally gave this product four stars, waiting for Amazon to correct the listing. Since I see they have not, I downgraded it to three stars. That's pretty generous, as this is outright misrepresentation. The only possibility I can see that exonerates Amazon here is if the product has been changed to organic to match the description. However, given that several people have gotten nonorganic product, and I likely wasn't the first to complain, I wouldn't count on any change having been made.

{"reviewText": "As a rabid, unrepentant coffee-drinker, I had to try this product.  Although I love the flavor and texture of French roast coffee, it's acidity tends to wreak havoc once inside of me.  Given my (minimum) two-cup a day habit, coffee can be tough going, to say the least.The Puroast brand delivered on the caffeine, but I found the flavor to be a bit bland, both straight and with cream.  I generally like my French roast to be strong, sharp and over-powering (so as to awaken me with a jolt and keep me fully hyped up), but the flip-side of this is typically very high acid content with the usual medical complaints.  To achieve that same full sensory experience, I had to use a bit more of it- about 1.5 times the usual amount of grounds that I brew of typical French roast in order to achieve a similar 'kick' from the coffee.In passing, I also like to spice up my coffee with either 1) a little cinnamon and Kahlua (usually during winter) or 2) one part twenty-year aged rum, minimum two parts Grand Marnier, chasing both with a strong batch of French roast filled to the rim of the mug (a kind of after-dinner dessert on the weekends for me).  I tried the latter recipe with and without a touch of cream, and while typically the coffee tends to eclipse the flavor of the alcohol mix, with Puroast both the aroma and taste of the aged rum and the Gran Marnier came through right nice as my ever-so-sensible British friends are fond of saying.  I also found that for best results with the combo of aged rum and Grand Marnier, Nestle's Coffee Mate French Vanilla product provided the best results, which featured a smooth, even finish combined with a creaminess that was, well, positively orgasmic!In sum, this product is an adequate and satisfying entry to the coffee space, and I highly recommend it to those who literally cannot 'stomach' their coffee.", "summary": "Works As Advertised", "overall": 3.0}

I like licorice (a lot) but not in the background of everything I sweeten.I'm not using what I bought but others might find the product to be wonderful. Especially if you absolutely must restrict your intake of sugars. It is very popular in Japan and growing in popularity in the USA. It could be exactly what you are looking for and it certainly is better than any near zero calorie alternatives I've found. I would suggest trying one packet someplace before buying 200 of them.10-11-06 Update: Wisdom Natural Brands saw this review, emailed me and said they  will replace any box which contains hard packages. Because of the weather, they had some product which absorbed water making the Stevia, as I mentioned above, taffy-like. A limited problem apparently. Doesn't affect quality or taste, just makes the product slower to dissolve.

Though not instructed to do so, I stirred the product well in between the cooking and resting times in order to make certain all of the flavor powder is thoroughly blended; this works well, as it results in a consistent, albeit thin sauce.I had to wait far longer than one minute for the sauce to thicken, yet it still came out thin. The thickness of the sauce probably depends on how much of the powdered mix boils out over the top of the cup. I had better luck with the brown rice version, which I prefer over the white rice version.This product contains twenty-eight percent of the recommended daily sodium intake, along with thirteen percent of both the daily carbohydrates and saturated fats, so this product is by no means a healthful alternative to nonrestrictive boxed macaroni recipes.

It's going to have a bit of canned flavor, smell and texture -- not like Grandma's homemade pot roast.But considering that, this is a convenient and pretty well done product for a canned food.  There is a good balance of roast beef chunks to gravy.  I would say you definitely get two servings per can and, depending on use, three or even four servings.  (I can't remember what the can claims as number of servings but I think it was two per can.)  A hungry person or big eater might want to consume the entire can.This isn't a product where you'd buy it just for the roast beef, draining off the liquid; this is intended to include the gravy as part of the overall dish.  That makes it convenient for things like topping a baked potato, mashed potatoes, grits, toast, rice, pasta, or whatever you like.  But it's specific in that sense.  If you need canned beef for other purposes, you will want to buy another different product.The roast beef is tender and tastes good.  I haven't encountered any fat or grisly bits.  The beef chunks tend to be around 1/2\" to 1\", roughly, and most of them are pretty consistent in size.  The gravy, while slightly \"canned\" for my taste, is still okay.  The product is not overly salted, which is a big plus.Besides the obvious uses, you could use this as simply beef gravy if you wanted, by breaking up the chunks into smaller bits.  The chunks flake into bits easily.  That might be good if you are feeding to young children and don't want to worry about them gacking on a big piece of meat.

It looks like white bread, though the loaf is considerably smaller both in width of slice and length of loaf than the typical grocery store (gluten-filled) bread. I noticed it was quite hard in the package so when we got it home I opened it up and toasted it (one slice). I put some blackberry jelly on it and ate it. It seemed fine taste-wise. Though it was a tough bread. Then just a moment ago I decided to make a sandwich out if it. I put a good layer of mayo on it, 2 layers of the Carvingboard turkey lunch meat and then a slice of smokey provolone cheese. My first impression of it was it was very dense and it tasted like and felt like it was powdery as I first began chewing my first bite. The taste was not gross or weird. Though it did NOT taste like typical wheat bread. But I guess you should expect that when there is NO wheat in it at all. It's made from rice flour. I can live with the taste if I want a sandwich. Though the density of the bread is kind of a turn-off. I think if Ener-G sliced the slices in half (1/2 the thickness they are now) it would make for a better sandwich since the density is so high. You'd get more sandwiches worth of bread out of the package so it would effectively cost 1/2 per loaf (though of course you'd pay the same but you'd get twice as many slices!!) If I had a way to effectively cut each slice in half I would.The taste was powdery and different but it wasn't gross in any way. What really threw me for a loop was the density of the bread.

Nothing worse than having a dozen of something from which your baby will feed YOU a complete diet of frowny faces!My baby seems very interested in this puree for about three bites, and then starts pushing it away.  I've read other reviews where the kid loves it.  So... to each their own!  Our baby is a fairly omnivorous eater, though, and seems to like most fruits, so I'm not sure what this says about this particular flavor.Other than that, make sure you know that the Apple/Cherry/Pear is all blended together; there are not separate apple pouches, cherry pouches, and pear pouches.  Also know that the entirety of the ingredients is apple puree, cherry puree, pear puree, vitamin c and citric acid.  A relief to not see that long list of mysterious leftovers from my chemistry class!!  As a result, though, once it's been opened, this has to be eaten within 24 hours or disposed of.  I think this is true of most pureed baby food, but, it's worth mentioning.This type of packaging is common now, where you can squeeze the puree into a bowl, or directly into a hungry mouth, or attach these little spoon contraptions and squeeze the puree right onto the attached spoon for direct, albeit somewhat odd, delivery to a younger mouth (&#34;Stage 2&#34; is for 6+ months).Baby and I have agreed on 3.5 stars for this stuff.  A reasonably healthy fruit-on-the-go option for 6+ months, good to fall back on if needed.  I think we might get fewer frowny faces from the banana-blueberry variety.

After drinking this, I can honestly say that I'm underwhelmed.Taste-wise, this isn't bad but it isn't great either. It's pretty much your run of the mill canned expresso beverage and while I've had worse, there wasn't that much to make it stand out. As others have said, the cocoa flavor just isn't there. That wouldn't actually be something I'd speak out against, except that the drink does claim that it's in there and there will be people who will be expecting to actually taste cocoa. It's not here, or if it is then it's so faint that you wouldn't be able to taste it unless you're really, really looking for it.Now the good thing about this is that it isn't overly sweet. I do like sweet coffee/expresso beverages, but a lot of times the bottled or canned beverages will be just overly saturated with it. This drink isn't, which was actually a nice change of pace and something that I know some of you will appreciate. Another thing that some might like is that it's only 100 calories for the full can, which was nice. It's still 19 carbs, but it's good to have a low calorie option for those of us that are trying to avoid the coffee drinks that have a bajillion calories.Overall, this just didn't stand out that much to me. It's good enough that I'd probably buy it if I was at the store, wanted a cold coffee/expresso drink, but didn't want anything sweet.

It could have easily been a jalepeno or something further down on the Scoville scale.Like the \"Razzpotle\", the flavor is a bit too overpowering to be used as an ingredient.  You are pouring \"Mango Ginger Habanero Sauce\" on top of cooked food, and that is about it.  I like getting creative as a chef, and props to those who found other uses for this, but I couldn't do much with it except eat it straight out of the bottle.Probably my favorite use for this sauce, and the same with the \"Razzpotle\", is as a straight jam on toast.

{"reviewText": "EDIT, 1/3/14: I finally figured out the nutrition label: serving size on the label says .35 oz.  That turns out to be 1/3 the serving size on your garden-variety peanut butter you can buy in the store (I'm comparing here, Kroger, which I adore).  The latter, gives you 8 grams of protein per oz., but 190 calories, of which 140 are fat.  And, a pound of it costs about $3.  So it's great for frying Chinese food, but essentially you're buying fat.  Thus the cost per ounce, is $3/16, or 19 cents.By contrast, this powder (rounded and ratioed up to the same specs for comparison) would provide about 15 grams of protein per ounce, but only 130 calories, of which only 33 are fat.  And it's far more peanutty.  Cost per ounce becomes 14/16 = 88 cents (pre-shipping cost), but you're getting twice the protein and almost no fat: so really 44 cents.  There's no way to compare the fact you don't need as much of the powder, to get the same amount of peanutty taste from the butter.  So it's really cheaper than 44 cents, but I can't say how much cheaper.  What tastes 'peanutty' to me, might not require as much powder for you.Original review, follows below.==================I can't live without peanut butter.  Well, obviously I could, but don't want to.  However, as you know, peanut butter is high in calories, as well as high in B vitamins.  So what to do, when wanting to eliminate the former, but get the latter?  Get this.It tastes ONLY like peanuts, and is only a peanut 'flour', clearly marked on the container but not in the Amazon description.  No buttery taste, no sweetener.  Nutrition info is kinda hard to fathom, hence four stars:  .35 oz per serving, what does that mean?  A teaspoon?  Less?  I don't know.  Per the label, you thus get about 1-3% of RDA for the typical nutrients (B vitamins, except that niacin is 16%, iron, calcium, etc).  4% for zinc.  Calories are listed as 43, 11 from fat.  So that's a plus.I'd use this powder in a number of ways:  to mix with yogurt or chocolate whey protein (since the latter is almost always too sweet), to add to oil in lieu of peanut oil, to sprinkle anywhere I want added peanut taste.  Example: just to experiment, I added a teaspoon of the peanut powder to scratch-made lentil and onion soup: straight into the 16 oz bowl.  The fresh peanut smell was very strong, and it unexpectedly enhanced the already great flavor.  What a surprise.  (Soup consists of lentils, chopped Spanish onions, granulated chicken broth, and a 'blackening' I make from the remnants of popped corn seasoning.  Didn't think the peanut taste would enhance that, but it did.)Instructions don't say, but I'll store this in the fridge.

{"reviewText": "This was my first time to try \"Vitamin Squeeze\" brand water enhancer, although I am very familiar with the similar Mio brand that's been on the market for quite a while.  Even though I knew that this container would be 12-ounces, I was still amazed when I opened the box to discover how truly large this bottle was compared to Mio water enhancer.  The Vitamin Squeeze bottle is about three times larger than a Mio bottle, although it actually holds 12-ounces as opposed to Mio's 1.6-ounce.  But please note that they actually offer the exact same number of servings (24).  Mio is concentrated, while Vitamin Squeeze is not -- as was clearly stated on the package.  As far as taste, quality, and appearance was concerned, I don't think the lack of concentration made any difference.  It's also worth noting that Vitamin Squeeze should be kept in the fridge, unlike Mio which I store in my pantry.  This might be a serious issue for those interested in carrying a bottle around in a purse or gym bag, in addition to its unwieldy size.I received one bottle of the Fruit Punch flavor to try out, and I decided to compare it directly with the Mio version of Fruit Punch to provide a more accurate review.  Mio's punch is a bright, rich -- almost unnatural -- red, like Kool Aid, and it tastes like it too.  Vitamin Squeeze delivers a more subtle pink-orange colored beverage, and the taste is very different.  It is not overly sweet, like Mio.  In fact, my first impression was that it tasted more like the fruit punch flavor of Gatorade I drank years ago when I was in high school.  I tried the Vitamin Squeeze at different times of the day.  It was not a very pleasant drink first thing in the morning, though it was actually quite refreshing -- more so than the sticky sweetness of Mio -- after a morning workout.  I tried to drink it with a meal but quickly gave up.  I'd rather enjoy water or soda.  This \"fruit punch\" stands on its own and didn't see to go well with food of any kind.  Finally, I let my four-year-old daughter try it for the ultimate test.  She's a big fan of Mio, which she calls \"magic fruit punch,\" and often uses it at dinner to flavor her water.  She disliked Vitamin Squeeze and would only drink one sip, which she dismissed as unsweet and yucky.My conclusion is that, while Mio's Kool Aid-type punch is great for kids, Vitamin Squeeze is probably a better choice for active adults, especially since it does provide a few vitamins (nothing much beyond your typical 100% Vitamin C) and tastes great and not too sweet after a workout.  The 12-ounce bottle is a bit clunky, needs to be stored in the frige, and you really have to squeeze a couple of generous full-bottle squirts into your water bottle to get a real taste of the product.  I have my doubts that my bottle will make it all the way to a full 24 servings, and I stopped keeping track after about six or so.  Given the choice, I think I would choose Vitamin Squeeze over Mio.", "summary": "For active adults, better choice than Mio", "overall": 4.0}

Inside you get 12 individually wrapped packages of cookies, so I think they will stay fresh for a long time.  I was a little disappointed by the appearance of the cookies, however.  They are not as pretty or detailed as the last, smaller box of cookies that I had.  That box had four different shapes; triangle, oval, round and fingers.  They all had nice holes poked in them and except for the fingers, scroll type edges, very attractive.  This box contained the triangles, round and fingers. Probably as many round ones as the other 2 shapes combined. Also about half of the fingers appear to maybe be square, having not been cut in half. That makes for a pretty large cookie and harder to ration if you only want to eat one.. I prefer them smaller.  I also like to dunk them in my coffee if I am eating them in the morning and they would be too big to dunk.  The triangles are very similar in appearance to the ones in the other box.  The round ones are just plain round cookies, no holes and no scrolls.  The fingers have the fork holes, but just not as pretty as the ones from the other box.  Also, a fair amount of the round ones arrived broken in half.  Of course that doesn't affect their taste and they are delicious, just like my first box-- light, delicate, buttery and fresh.

However, Oreo cookies are delicious beyond belief.  Not only are Oreo cookies delicious, but I sometimes think I hear Oreo cookies calling my name as I walk by them.  Honest.  I am unable to buy Oreo cookies because if I do I know I will eat them; generally in a few days.  Not a good idea.Nabisco, realizing that many of us are making some nominal attempt at eating more healthy foods, have created a brand-identified snack eliminates all the bad fats and most of the fat, creating a yummy and crunchy chocolate wafer snack that is like a chocolate cracker.  To this point no one has ever created a truly healthy snack that is like a cookie.  However, this wafer snack, which Nabisco has decided not to call a cookie, perhaps because cookie sounds fattening, is reasonably yummy.  I have eaten these things several times and still eat them.  I actually eat them more than regular Oreos, which I count as quite a nod to health.You may be tempted to add icing to this baked cookie.  If you are going to add the fat and calories in icing, perhaps you should just skip in pretense at reducing calories and fat and go straight to regular Oreo cookies.  In fact, just revel in the calories and go for the Double Stuff Oreos.Oreos have been around since 1912, and remain the best-selling cookie brand in history.  According to our friends at Kraft, which owns Nabisco, and which is owned by the Altria Group (renamed from Philip Morris, presumably for marketing reasons), more then 450 billion Oreo cookies were sold in the first 90 years of their existence.  Though Oreo Thin Crisps fall quite a bit short of the real thing, they are high quality and have sufficient flavor that allows these baked chocolate wafers to have the Oreo name.Of course, you could just stick with rabbit food and be truly healthy, but where is the fun in that?  For those of us that find a constant diet of veggies to be just too healthy to be fun, and yet the thought of pigging out on a pound of Oreos smacks of chunks of fat floating through our circulatory system, Oreo Thin Crisps are a lovely alternative.  Or course, you probably should avoid eating pounds of these, even with the reduced fat.  Food is food and too much low fat food still is not good for you, even if it tastes good.

As far as Organic goes, thsi is definately not on the top of the list as far as qaulity goes. The other brands had a more pure looking color and was a finer powder. You did not see black specks or tan specks really. It was a consistant orange powder. This Indus Organic power has tiny black specks and tan specks along with tiny unground fibers. Also, when you pour the powder out it causes less dust, which means it is not as fine of a grind. Because of the lack of dust and the small fibers, it is obvious to me that somewhere somebody saved some money by not grinding this pepper down as much as competitors do. Also, it is obvious that stems or something else is being ground with the peppers that are not in some competing powders because of the black specks and tan specks. It certainely tastes like Cayenne pepper, and it is hot like I expected. However when I ate about 1/5 of a teaspoon full expecting to be almost choking and expecting to have a mouth full of cayenne flavor, I got alot less flavor than I expected. It had the heat I expected but not the overpowering punch I expected with the amount I used. It seems that there is a good amount of stems or something else from the plant that is ground along with the peppers which makes the overall powder feel like you are getting less actual pepper.

I mention that not to brag but because Pure Bar was rather miserly with their sample size and I received a whopping one bar. With a product like this it can be difficult to make an accurate judgment, particularly on taste with just a single bar but I will try to do just that.It certainly wasn't love at first bite. The \"Pure\" bar is rather dense and chewy with large chunks of nuts, dates and blue berries. My initial reaction was to compare it to a fruit cake and I am not a fan of fruit cakes. After a few more bites it started to grow on me but then it was done. In the end I would give the taste a good score. It's not as tasty as a candy bar but it's not advertised as a desert, it falls under the category of cereal bar. As a breakfast replacement it's good for people on the go and I could definitely see it useful for travel and sports for a quick burst of energy.Where Pure Bar excels is in the ingredients and I'm willing to accept a less than staggeringly awesome taste given the fact that there are precisely zero chemicals and preservatives. Well, actually I'm not sure what Rice Protein Concentrate is but the rest is just dates, cashews, blue berries, walnuts, agave nectar and almonds. As the back of the bar says \"that's all! Nothing cooked. Nothing processed. Completely PURE.\".Nearly $1.70 per bar is a little high but not killer. You can get a bit of mileage out of 190 calories and I figure there is an extra overhead to getting all organic ingredients with no preservatives. This price is marked down from $2.50 a bar and at that price I would take a pass. You could buy a decent meal of fruit from the grocery store for the price.

Coffee snobs may turn up their noses at instant coffee; and it's true that nothing beats a well-brewed cup of freshly made java.  But sometimes speed is of the essence and all you really need is a smooth, solid mug.  Of all the instant coffees I've tried, this one is the best.The coffee itself has a very nice, rich flavor.  It is instant coffee, so don't be expecting the greatest cup of Joe, but compared to other instant coffee brands Taster's Choice is by far the most appealing.  I take mine with a little bit of milk or half and half (whatever I've got in the fridge) because I tend to find the coffee a little bit too bitter when it's black.One change that I've noticed and disliked in the last few years has nothing to do with the coffee crystals but is in the container.  For years, this coffee was sold in a nicely shaped glass jar with a solid metal lid sealing in the flavor.  Nowadays Nescaf&eacute; distributes their coffee in a tall plastic container.  My objection to the change is not based on aesthetics (although the look and feel of the original is far preferable to the modern plastic abomination), but rather how fresh the product stays.In the glass container, I could have the coffee crystals sitting around for months and they would be just the same as they were when the jar was new.  But with the plastic container, I find that it simply doesn't do as good a job as the glass for keeping the crystals dry and fresh.  Very often, as the weeks and months go by, the crystals start getting damp and clumping together forcing me to break up large chunks of coffee crystal lumps, something which never occurred in the glass container.To solve this problem, I ended up finding an old Nescaf&eacute; Taster's Choice glass jar and simply reusing that one over and over again.  Every time I need a refill, I wash out the old jar and fill it with the coffee I bought in the plastic container.  I'd like to think that Nescaf&eacute; is still producing the glass jars somewhere, but if so I've haven't found them.For instant coffee that actually tastes like coffee, I've been happy with Taster's Choice.

Good, but if you're looking for a deep, rich flavor this will disappoint.

I am a big fan of BBQ sauces... but this is more like a sweet ketchup - made with mangos instead of tomatoes - with a punch from the hababeros. It is not make-your-eyes-water hot. It is spicy however.The sauce was good added to Progresso Black Bean soup. I added a bit to grocery store hummus to give it a little kick. I tried it on left-over turkey sandwiches (VG!) and on fried ham slices I served with omletes (a bit too sugary). The sauce is pretty sweet, so I learned: when I add a tablespoon of this sauce, I also add a tablespoon of lemon or lime juice to counterbalance the sugar.I first tried cooking with the sauce by thinly coating cod filets and then grilling over a medium low fire. The sauce definitely overwhelmed the white fish. All I could taste was mango-sugar-hot sauce.Then I tried a 2 pound pork tenderloin on the grill. Thinly coated it with equal amounts of sauce and lemon juice and grilled it over medium. It was 25 minutes to heavenly bliss.Then I made a sweet potato chicken curry and put a 1/2 cup of the sauce in it. YUM YUM YUM. Here is the recipe:1 tablespoon cooking oil1 tablespoon Taste of Thai Red Curry Paste1 tablespoon of fish sauce1 medium yellow onion, cut in 1/2\" dice1 sweet potato, peeled and cut in 1/4\" slices4 split chicken breasts (skin and bone-on)1 13.5 oz. can coconut milk1/2 cup Mango Ginger Habanero Sauce1/4 cup lime juice2 tablespoons dark brown sugar1 red bell pepper, cored and sliced 1/4\" thick2 cups long grain white ricegarnishes: shredded coconut, thin lime slicesIn a 5 quart dutch oven (or \"chef's pan\"), heat oil over medium high heat. Stir in Red Curry Paste and fish sauce. Cook and stir until the curry paste is dissolved. Stir in onions and sweet potato slices. Cook and stir until brown -  about 5 minutes. Push them to the side of the pan (if your pan has room) or put them in a medium bowl to wait.Turn the heat to medium. Add chicken, skin-side down. Cook the chicken on medium until it begins to brown, about 10 minutes. Turn it to coat it with the spices. If you took the onions out earlier add them (and any juices in the bowl) back to the pan and toss to coat.In the bowl, whisk together the coconut milk, Habanero Sauce, the lime juice and brown sugar until blended. Pour over the chicken. As the mixture heats, turn the chicken and vegetables to coat them well. Scrape up any brown bits on the bottom of the pan. As the sauce reaches boiling, turn chicken skin-side up, scatter red bell pepper over all and loosely cover the pot. Reduce heat to medium low. Simmer with the lid slightly ajar for 30 minutes - or until the sauce is smooth and the chicken and sweet potatoes are tender.While the curry finishes, cook the 2 cups of rice according to the package directions.Serve the chicken curry over rice. You can top it with a bit of shredded coconut and a lime slice or two if you would like.It made 4 generous servings. The recipe doubles easily for leftovers and it was (needless to say), even better the next day.

{"reviewText": "I love hot chocolate, in winter especially for warming you up on particularly cold days. It's a nice alternative to coffee or tea and has the added benefit of bringing you back to childhood, or at least it does for me.While I love hot chocolate, I generally stay away from it due to the large amounts of sugar.  I've been watching sugar and carb intake for close to 14 years now, and try to look for products that contain only non-caloric sweeteners.  This hot chocolate has sucralose (aka Splenda) as well as Acesulfame Potassium, which I know less about.  At least it doesn't have aspartame, which I've heard many concerns about.  I'd love to see Swiss Miss go even further and offer a hot chocolate with the all-natural sweetener stevia.  At 4g of carbs per serving, it's even doable on a low-carb diet, but you'd probably need to limit it to one a day or so.  Still a nice treat regardless.The mouthfeel of this as opposed to a regular hot chocolate is definitely different.  The lack of sugar makes it feel lighter/thinner, which at least for me is a disadvantage, but not a horrible one.  The taste is fine, albeit not incredibly rich, it's still close enough to the sugarfied stuff that I'm fine with it.One thing I've found that will definitely help, is if you drink coffee, adding it to a small amount of coffee or espresso can really enbolden the taste, almost creating a \"mocha\" drink.  I haven't tried adding milk to it as I fear it might dilute that punch.Each box of these comes with 8 packets, so for a six-pack, you're talking about 48 packets total.

He IS from New Orleans after all--we all know they eat anything in South Louisiana--haw haw!

I am liking these I do think.\"\"Ungh.\" He grabs cheese from the fridge and breaks off a hunk, eats heartily.I take another bite and then another. It's not so bad at all.

Uh uh,\" GMR finishes off his cheese and is wandering to the tv remote.I finish my Pure Natural Bar and drink down a big glass of water, for they do make me thirsty--that's not a bad thing, right? Nope. Whew. Sure was sticky and chewy, but I like chewy sometimes. What I really like is that it isn't too sweet--I hate sickly sweet stuff, especially in bar things that aren't candy bars.I think I say this out loud to GMR, but I'm not sure, since the back of his head isn't answering.I say to the back of GMR's head, a little louder, \"You know, this bar kind of filled me up some.

As such the review drops down to a 4 star review of a Kona Blend.To start the coffee is a great coffee, very balanced, and great flavored.  The aroma is lacking in my opinion, at the very least not as robust as i'm typically used to in my coffee.  The Kona flavor is very mild, it's not an overly Kona flavored blend, lending me to believe that they use less than 35% Kona in this coffee.  Probably more like 20-25% Kona at best...and 15-20% Kona in reality.Of all the coffee that i've tried, this is a great coffee, but it ranks as 4th out of 4 Kona and Kona blend coffees that I have had.  Kona is my favorite coffee of all time beating out Jamaican Blue Mountain, Sumatra, and Yirgacheffe coffees.The flavor profile of the coffee is where it gets exciting even though it's not a full on Kona flavor.  It is very good coffee as soon as it hits your tongue.  The coffee is not overly bitter yet it is very strong flavored.  It lends itself to many different coffee drinkers.  Most coffees have a sweet spot that is necessary to a great cup of coffee.  I can make a 12 cup pot of coffee for my guests that consists of 7-8 scoops of coffee and it tastes nearly as well as a pot that i make for myself with 12-13 scoops.  Very reassuring when it comes to a pot of coffee that I know will not disappoint.Overall, the coffee is a great blend, seemingly taking the full flavored lack of bitterness indicative of the Kona bean and melding it with a great tasting arabica bean to afford a great coffee, just not the greatest Kona coffee of all time.", "summary": "Decent Kona blend, Great Coffee", "overall": 4.0}

When I hear the word \"Bold\" I expect something over the top and this one was just sort of medium.  It seems that they aimed for the middle of the road when it comes to being a spicy flavor!  We have Buffalo Wing restaurants here that offer about 6 grades of spiciness from hot to death and this wasn't even close.If I compare this to the Blue Diamond Wasabi & Soy spiciness it is not even in the same galaxy.  This is still a good flavor but not what I was expecting.One serving of these nuts is 170 Calories and it contains 6 grams of protein, 5 grams of carbohydrates, 3 grams of fiber and only 1 gram of sugar and 1 gram of saturated fat. You also get calcium, vitamin E and magnesium from the almonds which are good for your body, heart and bones. I would rather eat 28 of these almonds for 170 calories than 11 potato chips for the same calories and none of the dietary benefits.This flavor does have 9% of your daily intake of sodium which is almost twice the amount in many of the other Blue Diamond flavors. It has even 50% more salt than the Bold Salt `n Vinegar flavor? For that reason I will eat this flavor more sparingly.The only problem with these almonds is that they taste so good you have to be able to close the can and walk away. If you don't like the super bold and spicy flavors then this flavor is ideal for you, just watch the salt.I like all of the Blue Diamond Almond products as I feel that they are healthier for you as long as you don't overdo it in eating them. Since they have a more moderate flavor than what I was expecting for a \"Bold\" product and contain so much salt I gave it 4 stars.  I eat these almonds because they taste good and are healthier for you but the extra salt in this one negates some of the health benefits in my opinion.

I was eager to give their new Mayo with Olive Oil a try. I love olive oil, so I can't imagine this wouldn't work out well.One thing I noticed is that Hellmann's Mayonnaise with Olive Oil is thinner and creamier than the traditional mayo. You can't taste the olive oil so I'm assuming they use a lighter variety in their product, but it does have a thinner consistency. The flavor is also slightly different, a little less rich is the only way I can think of describing it. The squirt bottle is the perfect size, stores nicely in the fridge, taking up far less room than the standard jar.Given that, I am sold for the olive oil mayo for sandwiches, but I'm not as convinced that it would lend the same flavor and texture to pasta and potato salads. I need to test that out and when I do, I'll be back to revise my review.", "summary": "Not Bad, but Not Traditional Hellman's", "overall": 4.0}

I tried it first as dry cereal and was less than impressed.  The cereal is corn based so it had the aftertaste similar to Corn Pops cereal after the honey flavor wore off.  I believe Cheerios are whole grain and oats so there is a very distinct taste difference.After trying them with milk, I am much more impressed with the cereal.  They stay crispy for a long time (much longer than Cheerios) and the flavor is very nice.  The corn overtones are more subtle when mixed with milk so I get a similar taste to Honey Nut Cherios but with a hint of different flavor due to the corn base.  It is very nice but this will not replace my Cheerios anytime soon as I prefer the whole grain and oats based cereal.What's funny about me getting this cereal is that almost the same day my package arrived from Amazon, my wife had gone out food shopping and came back with a box of this cereal to try.

I usually add a couple of tablespoons of quality olive oil mixed with lemon juice to the bottom of the roasting pan and the tuck in some small peeled potatoes, large pieces of carrots and celery stalks cut in half.  You can add small Zuchinni or summer squash as well.  Cook at 350 until chicken is done and potatoes are tender.  Use a meat thermometer if you're oven is unreliable.  At the end, I add a drained can of black olives and put the meat and roasted veggies all in one serving platter and serve with crusty bread.  The roasting liquid and the spices from the Seasoning packet flavor the oil and juices.  People like to soak them up with the bread.

Only Kashi had the same amount of protein; I buy this bar for the coconut, which I love almost as much as chocolate.  The Quaker Chewy Dipps had more fat than the other bars but was more delicious; it had a thick layer of creamy dark chocolate that completely covered the bar.On this website, I posted a photograph that compares nutrition facts for three of the five bars.If you want a more muscular, lean physique, I highly recommend Kellogg's Special K Granola Bars because they have more protein and less fat.

I really wasn't familiar with any of the claims as a weight loss supplement, and I didn't really believe that this product could be effective in that capacity.  (Even other supplements that have gotten extremely positive reviews, such as garcinia cambogia, have not been effective for me in terms of weight loss.)This syrup is nicely packaged in a sturdy plastic bottle.  A 1 tsp. serving has just 13 calories, with no fat or sugar.  Before using it anything, I sampled a little straight from the bottle--wow!  I was VERY surprised that this syrup actually tasted so good.  It has a rich, sweet flavor that is somewhat similar to molasses, but without the more bitter, distinct flavor.  It is definitely hard to describe, but it is a bit like a combination of liquid brown sugar and honey--yum!I have tried yacun syrup in many different things.  It is a bit TOO sweet for me in coffee, but I love it in herbal tea.  It is also great to add sweetness to yogurt or oatmeal (especially unsweetened versions).  I am sure there are plenty of other uses!  According to the bottle, there are 48 servings, but after less than two weeks, I am finding that my syrup is almost gone.  I have used it on multiple times some days...but still, it seems to have disappeared awfully fast.Finally, I will mention that I monitor my weight on a weekly basis, and in the two weeks I have been using this syrup, my weight is down about 1.5 lbs.  It could just be a coincidence, but I had been pretty stuck at the same weight for quite awhile before.  I would love to continue using the syrup to see if I continue getting similar results, but it is VERY expensive for such a small bottle that gets used up so quickly.So, in summary, I would recommend this product IF you can afford to buy enough of it!

I was really pleased with my first batch of Flapjacks (I had never heard of that term, or if I did it did not stick), and was able to enjoy them thoroughly. Or should I say we, for I refuse to eat alone if I can help it. I normally make my own batter, an old family recipe that requires accurate measurements, plus a few ingredients, and more steps than one. When I am patient and careful, they are very good indeed, but as of last my so called pancakes have taken a turn toward the mediocre kind, and when I came across this great product called Kodiak Cakes Frontier Flapjack & Waffle Mix, 24-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6), I was very intrigued to say the least. So I purchased after reading the knowledgeable and glowing reviews by the well respected amazon reviewers, I never had seen so many enthusiastic reviews for Flapjacks (I love that name), and after reading the nutrition box to see how many carbs they were all about, I was gladly surprised and encouraged by the findings.Boxes arrived, cabin like, outdoor like packaging, so much in fact, I was thinking of a mini camping trip on the backyard to add to the overall effect, perhaps myself cheating a little bit and going to my King Size where I reach deep levels of sleep without a hitch, but making sure to be the first one up to start the Flapjacks. I almost felt like hiding the boxes, and pretending it was all my skillful ways that made it happen.

Add great syrup, Smuckers Sugar Free for the sugar intolerant, and regular Maple or your preference for the rest, quality butter (worry about heart attacks a little later), and eat them while they are hot!The real beauty is that for regular Flapjacks all that is required is plain clean water from the streams, or the refrigerator in our case, and follow closely the sound advice found in the their website, kind of like the big no no's of making flapjacks, one of the most important: do not over steer the batter, do not overcooked, do not flatten (leave them be!), etc. I wanted to take the credit, but really, it belongs to Kodiak Cakes Frontier Flapjack & Waffle Mix!

I have also used it to make Kool-Aid for the kids and it tasted very good as well. When making Kool-Aid I only had to use about a third of what I normally use.

In the spirit of whenever I decided to try a bar as my breakfast; the question I had was would one bar provide sufficient nutrition to carry me to lunch without getting hungry mid-morning. I can report that it did just that; I didn't even think about food until after 12 PM. So I would count that as a success.In all fairness I must admit that my lifestyle that morning was much less than vigorous and active and one who is engaging in an active lifestyle with much physical exertion will probably need to supplement one bar.The bar is rather soft and chewy and has a fruity flavor that reminded me of dates; I checked and there are no dates listed so I'm not sure what I tasted. The list of ingredients starts with Gluten-Free Oats with Organic Agave as the second ingredient; the agave is also known as the Century Plant. The third ingredient is a rice blend which includes some rice flours, tapioca starch, and xanthan gum. Walnuts were pretty far down the list and I don't recall encountering any chunks of walnuts. There was, however, a warning for people with allergies that the product was processed on equipment that makes other products that use peanuts and other tree nuts, soy and milk.From a nutritional perspective each bar has 180 calories, 9 grams of fat, 15 mg of cholesterol, 140 mg of sodium, 2 grams of dietary fiber, and 2 grams of protein.I enjoyed my bar with a cup of coffee and found it sustained me all morning.

However, if you're looking for something to snack on that is salty and delicious, look no further than these crackers!  Basically, it's two 4-6 inch crackers with cheese spread between them, almost like the little crackers with cheese that kids (and some adults, of course!) eat.  This is a little, tiny bit healthier, though, as it does contain whole grain wheat flour in addition to the junky white flour.

Now, as for the taste, I find it to be deliciously junky, and I also have to admit that I find it hard to believe that the cheese filling is real since it tastes so fake.  There is no MSG added, which is a slight plus.  In each box, there are six packages of the earlier-described crackers and cheese.  The crackers, to me, didn't taste particularly like the round Ritz crackers that I'm used to, but still, they're quite yummy.

I never thought of Coconut Water as a sports drink but I thought I would give it a try.The package the drink comes in is \"Tetra Pak\"; which is a fancy way of saying juice box.  Because this seems very similar to the way I used to drink my Hi-C Juice when I was in grade school.  No straw here though, just a foil covered hole in which you peel off the foil to drink.Ingredients are as follows: Natural coconut water, pink guava puree, cane juice, vitamin c, and natural fruit flavor.  Not too bad, sounds good, you have to add vitamin c to give the drink a little zing otherwise it comes off too bland, and they at least admit to adding \"natural fruit flavor\" which if you read the FDA website doesn't really have to be that natural at all.  But all-in-all the ingredients list looks good.  One container is 8.5 ounces, one serving, and you have 78 calories, no fat, 128mg of sodium, 302mg potassium, 18.8g of carbs, with .5g of that being fiber and 16.6g being sugar.  You also get 0.8g of protein and the added vitamin c gives 183% of your daily value.  Let's move on to taste:Serve cold, shake well, and open...tastes like coconut and guava.  I guess I should have expected that.  It feels fairly light on the tongue, not that oily mouth coating feel you get from regular coconut water.  O.N.E. claims they get the water form green coconuts before the meat forms, so that accounts for the lack of oils and fats.  So you get nice tropical flavor.  Like a really watered down pina colada.

I drink coffee during work time but once the caffeine dies down, I drag myself to my workout, feeling tired and gloomy. The addition of the Celsius Calorie Burner in my daily routine provided me with some boost and motivation in terms of energy in my job and workouts. The 200mg of caffeine made sure I would be awake at work and the calorie burning properties of this drink made sure I would be burning more calories in my workouts. One good thing I must say about this drink is that it takes a longer time before the caffeine loses its effect because it is tea-based. Tea-based caffeine lingers much longer in your system compared to coffee or soda-based caffeine thereby giving you a much longer \"high\" on the caffeine. This \"high\" feeling is the thing that boosts your energy. Be careful though in taking this drink that has this much (200mg) caffeine in it if you have high blood pressure for caffeine increases your blood pressure significantly. After finishing the whole case of this drink, I did notice a marginal increase in my weight-loss. In my cardio workouts, I burn approximately 350-450 calories on exercise alone, not counting the time I spend lifting weights and taking this drink.

The reviews all raved so much about the flavor, that I decided to try it even though this is not something I expect to buy regularly. These are not sold in my local store so I couldn't try them first to see if I wanted so many. I wanted to post this review because I think there are some key things the other reviewers so far have not mentioned. I'm going to put the cons first, since there has already been plenty about the pros in other reviews:Cons:1. This is shipped with dry ice in styrofoam, inside a cardboard box. Perhaps other people know about how to deal with dry ice, but I have never been around it before - I've only seen it on TV used for special effects. I opened the package and saw a bag at the bottom with something that looked like ice. Since I had to dispose of the carton, I grasped the chunk of ice inside the bag with my bare hand and put it in the sink for a moment - and burned my hand! Apparently, you should NOT touch dry ice, even through a bag. No major injury, but it could have been worse if I had held it longer. Be CAREFUL when handling the packaging.2. When I put the container outside minutes later to let the dry ice evaporate, after looking up how to dispose of it online, I got a very sudden feeling that I was going to vomit. I thought this was related to something else, but I felt that way for a full hour. Then the next day, when I was feeling better, I went to dispose of the container I had left outside. Again, immediately after getting near the container I got violently sick again, and realized it has something to do with the packaging, and I guess the dry ice since I've never been around it before. I have medical problems, so this may not happen to anyone but me. I looked up dry ice and this should not happen. But, I felt it was worth mentioning in case others have this strong reaction. Every time I got near it I got sick until I had been away from it in fresh air for about an hour. The reaction was too consistent to be something else, on days when I otherwise felt fine.3. Packaging aside, the taste of the pizza is pleasant. But, it tastes like spicy saag paneer with tomatoes on naan. If you like Indian like I do, this is a plus. However, with all the rave reviews about the flavor and people saying it tastes like garlic and pesto and not cilantro, it can be misleading. There is jalapeno in the ingredients, so it is spicy. So the flavor is kind of odd. If you don't know Indian food, it tastes like a combination of cheese, fresh tomato, cilantro, jalapeno, basil, and garlic... startling if you were expecting an Italian flavor. This is NOT Italian food. It's not typical Indian, either, but a fusion of the two.Pros:1. The pizzas were in fact still pretty frozen, even though they had been sitting in a hot humid climate for a good 6 hrs, after a few days of shipping, by the time I got to them.2. The pizzas are all-natural with no preservatives of concern, which in my book is a real plus, particularly for frozen food!3. The reviews are right, the tomatoes are really good, like thin slices of fresh tomato.4. It is hard to beat naan fresh out of the oven - soft and crunchy at the same time, it's like it's melting in your mouth.5. Not all that bad for you compared to other frozen pizzas: they use wheat flour, and while they are high in carbs, at least there are 4g of fiber and 18g of protein if you eat the whole thing to offset that (the nutrition info is listed for half of it, but the whole thing is the size of one large thick slice of pizza). Compared to other frozen pizzas of the same size, it may have slightly lower sodium at 825mg. The entire piece is definitely lower in fat than most frozen pizzas, at 6g with 2g saturated fat. The cholesterol comes in at 14mg, or 4%. I wouldn't call it health food, but this is perfect for comfort food and yet not as bad as most things that might qualify for that title.I don't know if I'll order again since I can make healthier food at home for far cheaper, but overall it was a positive experience.", "summary": "Indian Pizza in the Mail", "overall": 4.0}

We definitely took advantage of the samplers available for purchase on Keurig's own website.  I did my research ahead of time and had read a lot of favorable reviews of Timothy's coffee.  I enjoy medium roasts as well as flavored coffee and the German Chocolate Cake blend often received great reviews so I gave it a shot!This k cup is a very nice roast.  Flavorful, but not too bold.  The acidity was very well balanced and there was zero bitter aftertaste, which is a big winner in my book (I deplore bitterness in coffee!).  I think this is the kind of roast that can appeal to even the most particular of coffee drinkers because it's rich and full without being overwhelming.Onwards to the German chocolate cake flavor... I really like this.  It has an inherent sweetness to it and there is no mistaking the coconut scent as well as taste.  There is a little bit of chocolate as well, but the coconut is the stronger of the two favors, much like with any good piece of German chocolate cake.  If you're a fan of the dessert I can't imagine that you wouldn't enjoy this coffee.That said: if you're the kind of person who generally doesn't enjoy flavored coffees, but who might, on occasion, make an exception for a mild hazelnut or vanilla coffee, this is not the one for you.  The flavor in this coffee is very strong and might turn off people looking for something a little smoother with greater subtlety.I might repurchase this somewhere down the line after we go through the supply of k cups we've accumulated already, but I don't love this enough to want to go out and purchase some right away and retire the other favors we already have.", "summary": "A very good (but not great) Keurig k cup!", "overall": 4.0}

{"reviewText": "I have to admit, I was skeptical as I always am when it comes to flavored coffees. Flavored coffee usually does not taste good at all to me since it almost always comes at the price of having some kind of weird taste associated with the coffee flavor. This vanilla-flavored coffee has done a great job of mixing good coffee and flavoring without too much of that \"weird taste\" to it, however it doesn't altogether avoid it. If I were to wager a guess I'd say that there is some process that adds the flavoring and ensures it doesn't lose its potency which is the culprit for most flavored coffees having that strange taste, usually in the form of what I can only call a chemical-taste. Starbucks has minimized this, thankfully.I brew mine on the strong side, and usually put in more than what the package calls for because otherwise the coffee winds up on the weak side. Don't do that with this brand, or at least with this line of their brand. They are right on the money with the measurement. The first morning I brewed this it opened my eyes, but only because it was overwhelmingly strong. The next day it was much better after I toned down the amount. The brew turned out rich, strong, bold, and the vanilla flavor is very much a part of the aroma and taste. You won't need to worry about a weak pot of coffee that looks watery and tastes thin.The 11-ounce bag lasted about 2 weeks, with me drinking a pot brewed with 4 cups a few days a week. If you like flavored coffee, you will more than likely enjoy this and I'd say give it a shot. If you're a big coffee snob, then it's probably not for you. For the record I'm a borderline coffee snob, and although I wouldn't go out of my way to order it, I wouldn't turn down a cup if it was offered me like some of the other flavored coffees out there.", "summary": "Strong robust coffee without the bitterness", "overall": 4.0}

My only complaint - they are  bit pricey.", "summary": "perfect for dipping", "overall": 4.0}
{"reviewText": "QUICK SUMMARY: These bites are a tasty snack with a fudgey feel, slightly reminiscent of brownies from vending machines.  This version of a brownie snack is slightly healthier than other brands as far as calorie density and fat, but the sugars are still fairly high (as one might expect from a dessert treat).  I generally found the amount in a single package to be satisfying, and the bit of chocolate goo in the center added a unique texture that kept the product from having too dry of a mouthfeel.  Overall, I would buy these, particularly if they were on sale for less than $3 a box.PACKAGING:(Note - I received this product through the Vine program and it is possible that packaging will change between the review version and final launch.)The box contains five individually wrapped servings of bites.  Each serving is in a poly-sealed bag that is filled with some air as well as the product, to help prevent squishing. I tossed an individual pack into a very packed checked suitcase for a trip, and the bag held up alright.  While the air was gone, the product was not squashed or disintegrated at my destination.  As such, I think the packaging is fine.VISUAL IMPRESSION:The bites are about the size of a Starburst candy, perhaps a little longer.  While they look a little dry on the outside, there's a fudgey filling that is visible from the side. There's around 6-7 in a pack, which feels disappointing at first.FLAVOR:I found this to be a tasty chocolate treat.  It might be a reasonable substitute for a cookie.  They really did remind me ofLittle Debbie Fudge Browniesin flavor and texture, despite appearing less fudgey.  One pack generally felt satisfying for a chocolate treat, although I found myself wanting a bit more for a snack, despite the calories.NUTRITION:Snackwell's brand is based on healthy snacking, so, whereas I'd forgive many dessert treats for poor nutritional value, I hold Snackwell's to a higher standard.  Each 39g pack has 150 calories, no transfats, 27g of carbs (14g of which is sugar), and surprisingly, 2g of protein.  For comparison, the Little Debbie Fudge Brownie that this reminds me the most is 61g with 270 calories, no transfats, 39g of carbs (27g of which is sugar), and 2g of protein. (Note that, to make it a fair comparison, I compare per gram of snack.) Snackwell's brownie bites have a little more than half a calorie less than a Little Debbie Fudge Brownie.  Snackwell's brownie bites also have half as much fat, but about the same carbs and sugars.  Protein is a little higher with Snackwell's.  Snackwell's also includes 3g of fiber in this snack, unlike Little Debbie's version with zero grams of fiber.  So, I have to say that I do think Snackwell's has made a healthier version of a brownie snack.QUANTITY/VALUE:At around $3 a package, that's roughly 60 cents per pack.  That's vending machine prices, in my opinion.  In other words, you're paying a premium for a slightly healthier snack.  I would look for these to be on sale for under $3 a pack to buy them.", "summary": "Good brownie taste, slightly healthier than a \"full flavor\" snack. Good individual packaging.", "overall": 4.0}

I cannot tolerate gluten in any form without getting very, very ill so I was really excited to be offered this gluten-free elbow macaroni from Barilla to review for Amazon's Vine program.Unfortunately I discovered too late after ordering this product that one of the ingredients of the pasta - the Mono- and diglycerides - is suspect for not being vegetarian. I base this on the following information about Mono- and diglycerides from Wikipedia:\"Mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids (E471) is a food additive used as an emulsifier.These synthetic fats are produced from glycerol and natural fatty acids, from either plant or animal origin. E471 is generally a mixture of several products, and its composition is similar to partially digested natural fat.Concern for vegetarians and vegans:E471 is mainly produced from vegetable oils, although animal fats are sometimes used and cannot be completely excluded as being present in the product. The fatty acids from each source are chemically identical. However, vegetarians and vegans, not wishing to consume any animal products, generally avoid products containing E471 unless they are certain that it is derived from vegetable oils. Also, because there is a chance of pork fat being present, Muslims and Jews will also avoid products containing E471 unless they know that it is made from vegetable oil.\"For any Muslims and Jews who might be reading this review, this Barilla product is Kosher so it is safe to assume that the Mono- and diglycerides are not derived from a pork source.  But for vegetarians and vegans that's not to say that the source could not be derived from some other animal.  Since the label does not specify that this product is vegetarian my motto is \"Better safe than sorry\" and I passed on sampling this pasta.But I did give the pasta to my mother to try and she happens to be a non-vegetarian pasta lover with no gluten intolerance and this is what she reported back to me:- That the gluten-free pasta cooks up nicely and as good as any regular pasta.  It was not sticky or gummy.- That the gluten-free pasta had a unusual  smell when she opened the box but it didn't seem to effect the taste of the cooked pasta.- That she thought the pasta tasted good but she still prefers regular pasta and would not buy this gluten-free Barilla pasta over the regular.So based on my mother's feedback I rate this product with 4-stars but I do want other vegetarians who might care about such things to know that the Mono- and diglycerides may not be vegetarian. For those vegetarians I recommend my favorite gluten-free vegan pasta - Tinkyada brown rice pasta - any variety, all of which I rate with 5-stars.", "summary": "Notice to other vegetarians: this is a good gluten-free elbow macaroni pasta that may not be vegetarian", "overall": 4.0}

When this mix became available, I wanted to give it a try.If you've ever rolled gluten-free cookies, it's a bigger chore than the gluten-laden variety. For that reason, I opted for the roll-n-cut approach. I was immediately curious that the ingredients did not require room temp butter. Rather, softening with the mixer tipped me off that the dough would be a bit dry. That was an understatement. Much like a shortbread, the dough comes together crumbly, though barely. Even with the rolled option, it was interesting shaping it.I chilled it for about 45 minutes, and I think it would have been best to chill it longer. It sliced very easily and uniformly, though the centers were still crumbly. I had to compress them a bit.  I made half as snickerdoodles with a splash of cinnamon, and the other half thumbprints filled with homemade blackberry jam.They never really browned, even up to 12 minutes at 350 degrees. Any longer and they would have dried too much. Along that line, they required almost complete cooling before moving to a rack, as they were still a bit crumbly. Once cool their texture solidified more.The final product is very sweet--way too sweet for my taste. I've had sugar cookies that were incredibly flavorful without being overly sweet. These have a nice vanilla flavor, though it is overwhelmed by the sweetness. Perhaps a dash of salt would bring these more in balance. The cinnamon didn't stand up to the sweetness; however, the blackberry jam evened it out very well. The butteriness of the cookie paired wonderfully with the jam. I would make them again, as thumbprints.With a little courage, these could be a great base for other add-ins like peanut butter, toffee, garam masala, or lemon zest, as the package suggests.

{"reviewText": "The name: \"Crunchy Vanilla Sunrise\" evokes a lot.  The first word sets the tone, and unfortunately I tend to relate \"crunchy\" first with hippies, Earth shoes, organic detergent, underground homes, crystal-based religions, and a general flakiness.  Now one could argue that \"flaky\" and \"cereal\" is a good mental association, but I doubt the copywriters and marketers were thinking in this vein.  I think they were after the more visceral, literal, \"Hey, Velma, by the great white beard of Odin, this here cereal is mighty crunchy!  I can hardly hear myself think!\" outcome.  \"Vanilla,\" on the other hand, is what got me to order this product.  I love vanilla, and had to try this out.  \"Vanilla\" had me thinking \"deep, dusky flavor,\" as opposed to \"dull,\" which the box's back panel tackles unflinchingly.  And then you get \"sunrise.\"  Well, the mental association intent is evident here; it's all about setting a deep and contented feeling centered directly on the product, about the peace of morning and the promise of a new day, clear skies, golden light (see the box photo), bunnies, puppies, galactic serenity, etc.The package: the box I got is different than the official one shown here.  I prefer the box I got over the one shown--the front panel is oriented more to the customer, instead of oriented on the manufacturer.  If you're set on Nature's Path, then you'll find this product anyway; the company logo and name don't need to dominate the front of the box.  As for the back panel, I dunno.  What does \"the sweet breeze of a Mexican sunset\" have to do with breakfast cereal?  Is this a travel cereal?  And what exactly is a travel cereal, and how do I get it through customs?  And what of the photos of a rain forest, a beach resort, a Mexican air mail stamp, and a sun-worshiping woman sitting in the dirt?  Is this cereal best enjoyed in Mexico, in the dirt?  That, and there's bold language about the \"unique nutritional profiles of ancient grains . . .,\" although there is no further specification on what those profiles are, and why they are so totally extremely good for you.I do note that the front of the box, the top and one side panel call this product \"Crunchy Vanilla Sunrise,\" while the back-panel copy calls it \"Vanilla Sunrise Crunch.\"  Which one is it?  I prefer the latter, actually.The flavor dry out of the box isn't bad, and it would be an okay bagged snack for a hike or for a school lunch.  It was better in milk, in my case the standard 2%.  The very first thing I noticed is that this cereal separates in milk.  Now me, I like a lot of milk, as I like that all-important crunchiness toned down a bit, and I like to drink the cereal-flavored milk when I'm done.  If you're a sparse cereal-milker, then this won't be a problem for you.  With more milk theKix- andKrispies-like bits float, while theflakessink.  You've got to actively stir and dredge the bottom of the bowl to get your fully mixed cereal bounty promised in the box photo.And the taste: I thought it was great.  Very nice taste, with just the right amount of vanilla coming through.  Dry or in milk, it is slightly sweet to begin with.  I added a little bit ofEqualto sweeten it up a bit more.  The texture is a little screwy, with the crispies and flakes and puffs all mixing together, but once you start masticating, it's no longer an issue.Nutrition: I've provided a photo of the panel, so you sort it all out.  The one thing that I notice is that there are more than 100 calories in a single, tiny serving, and that's before you even add the milk.  No wonder it tastes sweet.  And it's officially and certifiably organic, etc.Bottom line: Sure, I'd eat this cereal again.  It's apparently good for me, which is a plus, and it tastes great.

I took off one star for the fruit juice, which makes it more like a drink than a food. I'm anti-juice, and the more of the solids you remove from a food, the less satisfying it is for your appetite.I did like that the pouch was the right size for the contents. It's less a trend with the applesauce marketed as a snack than the ones marketed as baby food, but I'm sick of seeing pouches 50% larger than this for the same contents.

Not to be put off, I sweetened my coffee the next day with the Splenda w/B vitamins and couldn't tell any difference in the taste of the coffee.  Also, the coffee covered up that vitamin smell you get with B vitamins.  As for the drink from the prior day, the orange juice is what gave it a strange taste so I fixed another cranberry/orange drink today.  I gave a glass of the drink to a family member and she didn't notice any strange taste or smell.  As for the amount of B vitamins, there are three added to the sweetener and only a small amount so you don't have to be too concerned that you'll OD on B vitamins.  The packets are made much heavier and thicker than the paper normally used so the vitamins aren't exposed to light and lose potency.

It contains hibiscus, orange peel, lemongrass, rosehips, natural raspberry flavor, licorice powder, and citric acid. The package says it also contains soy, but that makes little sense to me---but everyone should know this in case they are allergic. It is a fine tasting herb tea.If you like a more subtle tea, you may not be crazy about Wild Raspberry. But if you like Celestial Seasonings and other commercial teas, I think that this is a good one. The reason I gave this tea four stars instead of five is that it isn't as pure as it could be (contains additives and flavorings) and I can tell. I prefer a more subtle tea. And I save five stars for the very best teas I've tried. But for those of you who like a lot of flavor, and don't mind a few additives, it's just fine!This 100 count box is an economical way to enjoy this tea; however, I would try it first in a smaller quantity to be sure before you go for bulk!Recommended.****", "summary": "Flavorful Tea with Hibiscus Flowers and Some Flavorings", "overall": 4.0}
{"reviewText": "At the time I first tried this Skinny Cow product, I happened to have someRolo Minison hand, which I thought would make for a perfect comparison, since both products offer milk chocolate covered caramel.  The main difference is that Skinny Cow is presumably supposed to provide a lower-calorie choice, so let's first look at the nutritional content.  One serving size of Skinny Cow (1 individual pouch with three small square chocolates) has 130 calories, 7 grams of fat (4 grams saturated), and 15 grams of sugar.  One serving size of the Rolo Minis (11 mini pieces) is a bit higher in both calories (190) and fat (9 grams, with 5 grams saturated), and significantly higher in sugar.Regarding taste, the higher sugar content of the Rolos obviously adds something, as they have a much better flavor, particularly with the caramel, which has a great, chewy texture.  The caramel in the Skinny Cow product is thinner, and surprisingly, it tastes overly sweet, almost artificially so.  However, the flavor of the chocolate is good, and had I not compared this product directly with the Rolos, I'm sure I would have enjoyed it just fine.With 15 grams of sugar, this is still clearly not a health food, but if you are craving chocolate and looking to save a few calories, this might be a good choice.", "summary": "Good, but not as good as the real thing", "overall": 4.0}

Then we take the above seasoning, a very large pot of water, and put in the seasoning and the left over turkey (some of which we might freeze, but usually do not because it is turkey, and that cannot be kept for more than a couple of months in a freezer)... then we add carrots, celery, navy beans (or equivalent), a couple of cups of previous boiled barley (which has to be cooked a couple of hours to soften it, then we freeze it in proper sized bags for making the soup), add in fresh basil, a pinch of oregano, red pepper flakes to taste, black pepper (fresh ground is best).

Depending on your squeeze time the drink will be weak, just right or strong, so you have to figure out how you like it.

Additives give electrolytes also.The energy is thanks to the added natural caffeine, 40 mg per serving.This is good for covering up the bad taste of tap water or if you just hate the flavor of plain water. The best use of this for my family is to use it when my kids have no choice but to drink terrible tasting water while at Boy Scout camp. Add this to that awful hose water they use at camp, and the Scouts will drink the water provided and they will not only get hydrated but it adds some vitamins and electrolytes.

You will save money by purchasing this instead of premixed energy drinks, too.I think this product has its place although there is still debate over the necessity of drinking electrolyte drinks while doing non-extreme exercising vs. drinking just plain water, and some people will continue to debate whether sucralose should be a part of our daily diets and others seek to avoid food dyes.

While the best and most natural way to enhance the flavor of plain water is by squeezing fresh lemon or lime or orange into it, that tends to get boring AND expensive.  I received my 12 oz bottle of Fruit Punch flavored Vitamin Squeeze Energy a couple of days ago.  This product is housed in the upside down type bottles that are currently popular.  The top of the bottle features a snap lid that allows you to squeeze the product out slowly or quickly and it also allows you to turn the cap so it is removed entirely if you prefer to pour the product in a larger pitcher of water.I have tried other water enhancer products such as the one that is spelled with a certain 3 letters.  I did not care for those as they had left a weird chemical taste in my mouth.  I was pleasantly surprised when I tried Vitamin Squeeze.  This did not taste in any way to me like a no cal product.  I squeezed about 1/2 of a tablespoon into a 12 oz glass of filtered water and I thought I was drinking a watered down version of Hi-C fruit punch. All I tasted was fruit.  I didn't taste any diet sweetener at all.I looked at the differences in the ingredient labels of Vitamin Squeeze and that other enhancer brand I mentioned above.

The Electrolytes I understand as well.  The only ingredient problem I have with this product is the Red #40.  WHY do we have to have this product colored?  Is it a psychological thing?  I would be happy to drink my water CLEAR.  As long as there is some flavor in it I do not need to psych myself into thinking I am drinking something other than water by making it a different color.When I first opened this bottle and started squeezing I found leaks around the bottom edge of the screw on cap.  I was getting irritated and was going to blast the design in my review.  Then I started to think about it and unscrewed the cap.  When I first opened the protective paper opening I had only torn a triangle around 1/3 of the paper.  This was what was causing the leakage.  Remove the ENTIRE opening protector and you won't have the problem I had.  However, that said, when you are squeezing the bottle into a glass hold the bottle completely vertical because you will get a surprise squirt rebound if you don't.  LOL.  This product will stain your clothing and counter and floor.Overall, I really like this product.  Have I noticed an energy boost?  I don't know really but at least I am not getting a crash like after drinking other well known canned energy drinks.  I will keep using it and update this review if I have any issues with it.

They taste great and dissolve quickly leaving a wonderful minty aftertaste. Possibly if you carry the cute tin in your pocket and jostle them a lot, they might fall apart. But mine are right by my work station and another tin is in the vehicle.My interest in these began with reading a website of a dentist named Scott Frey. Apparently the birch sugar used in these cannot be utilized by the oral bacteria that cause dental plaque and decay. The dentist does not appear to have fiduciary interest in the products he has analyzed but rather is helping those of us trying to keep our dentition intact in our Western world of sugary offerings and too little time or ability to brush after eating, the best knowledge and opportunities to keep optimum oral health.

It may be that I am reacting to the omnipresence of that bitter, over-roasted stuff Starbucks pours. Well, this Marley blend is bitter as well, but intrinsically so, with a tongue-slapping sting. I don't feel that it is a product of over-roasting, but rather, the nature of the bean. I like it. It makes me want to sip it while alternating chocolate mousse and cabernet. Seriously. Try that combination for dessert sometime. It is the great triumvirate.I am particular about my coffee and yet compromise my taste by going the K-cup route. doing the 200 degree water drip through the unbleached paper with freshly ground beans thing is not for me on an very early weekday morning. I can barely put my pants on, let alone manipulate a container full of near-boiling water. That level of love is left for the weekend, when I have the time to take the time to linger lovingly over proper preparation as if it were the Tea Ceremony.That being said, there is no need to compound the sin of employing a pod or K-cup while using that stuff that sits on the grocer's shelf for months.

Then again, I am comparing it to those sugary cereals that people who are looking into this product are probably trying to avoid.  Adding some milk, I found that the cereal was very nicely balanced and has a very healthy taste.  That means that I felt good after eating it and not weighed down.  As for the technical nutritional facts, the ingredients and stats are listed here (a nice thing about Amazon).  The absence of high fructose corn syrup and the basic natural ingredients are quite reassuring, but, as with all granolas I've seen, portion control will be needed to keep the calorie count down (220 per half cup).  I found the texture quite good for cereal, crumbly bits and all, which is how I eat it.  It may be a bit messy for casual consumption by hand.Overall, this is really basic.  It would be quite inexpensive and easy to make this yourself.  That is not a bad thing, though.

I took away a star for that.

The taste is smooth, dark, slightly bitter, but still enjoyable and makes for a nice caffeine buzz. It's 100% organic and Fair Trade-very important to me. With the grounds contained in pods, it is easier to remove and keep the ground holder clean.The downside of the pod coffee is the separate foil packaging for each individual pod.

This doesn't matter so much but for some reason, I liked the pretzel sticks just slightly better than the twists though both were superb.Even when I selected these to try, I was skeptical about a gluten-free product actually tasting like its gluteny counterpart. These were almost better than a regular pretzel because they seemed just a bit lighter and crispier. And the sea salt was added in just the right amount. I dipped these in chocolate, tried them with dip, and ate them plain. They were absolutely delicious.The serving size is a generous 33 pretzels at 140 calories per serving. Carbohydrate count is about 22g, which is not bad. I wish there would have been a little bit of fiber count but that may be an issue with how gluten-free products are concocted.As for value/cost, they are only just slightly more expensive than regular pretzels so if you have an issue with gluten, this product will not be economically burdensome like many other gluten-free products.

I had always heard the benefits of eating steel cut oats but never did.Steel cut oats are whole grain and from the inner part of the kernel which has been cut in to pieces.It did take longer to prepare these oats, most cooks would prepare it on on stove stop and does take 30 minutes to prepare a serving and constant monitoring so that this thing does not stick to the bottom of the pot.So I prepare the the oatmeal in a slow cooker which saves us from the stress of watching the pot and the mess of having stick to the bottom of the pot.I usually use three cups of water to one cup of oatmeal and add whatever fruits and nuts I like to the crock pot. I leave that on a Sunday night and have warm oatmeal in the morning.  You can find several dozen recipes online for steel cut oatmeal.McCann oats are a great value as 6 packages  of 30 ounces canisters came up to 21.02  after subscribe and save.

I ordered a box each of the Columbian and the Breakfast Blend. The day they arrived I immediately had to try a cup. So I picked the Columbian , popped it into the Keurig ( as I have done a 1000 times!) and coffee grounds and water started splurting out of the sides like a fountain!! Ok so I thought it was it was just a fluke, so after cleaning up the mess , I decide to try another K-cup and the same thing happens again! This happened with both varieties consistently. This has rarely happened with any other K-cup variety I have tried since owning my Kuerig machine for 3 years now.I plan to contact Amazon about this even though they have a no refund policy on grocery items. But one thing is for sure I wont be purchasing anymore of this brand until they address this problem. I cant even comment on the taste of the cofffe.UPDATE!!! This company has outstanding customer service! After leaving this less than glowing  review , they contacted me! thats right! Emailed on a tuesday and had 2 new boxes on thurday! I have only tried the the Columbian(Love it!) and the Breakfast blend.Both were a very tasty medium roast that stood up well to creamer.Now that they have addresed the problem with a small batch from the preorders I will definately be ordering more.

{"reviewText": "When I have a cold, I crave juices, especially orange and another brand that makes a honey, lemon, and echinacea juice. Both come at the caloric hit of about 60 calories per a mere 8oz. When you are sick like this, lots of fluids help. I find that my throat is always so sore, I try to, but just can't drink water (normally, I drink 32-64 oz/day of plain, filtered water). Plain water with a bad cold hurts my throat while juices soothe it, but 8 glasses of an 8oz juice is a heck of a lot of calories/day added for a week or so while I am sick. Also, if I drink so much juice like that, it leaves me with such a heavy feeling in my abdomen.I bought this one and the lemon one and was hoping it would be just like the &#34;essence&#34; of the flavor and not a full out heavy and calorically packed juice taste and that's exactly what I got (A glass or 2 of juice/day is fine. I'm comparing this to 8 glasses). It's also perfect for needing to drink lots of water during a cold with a really scratchy throat. I drank both the lemon and this one all day long while sick easily getting a good fluid intake per doctor's orders.Now that I am better, I am back to plain, filtered water, although I still like to switch it up at least once or twice a day with one of these water enhancers.If you are looking for a full flavored juice, I recommend buying juice. If you just want to drink water where you have the option of swapping with a glass that has the essence of a fruit flavor without the calories. This is the answer.Oh, by the way, I read the directions, but I don't know why I did this, (probably because my head was stuffed with a cold and I forgot what I had read), but instead of counting for 10 seconds per directions for squeezing the water enhancer bottle's contents into the water. I give 10 full squeezes into 32 oz of ice water and its perfect for my taste buds. So, YMMV (your miles may vary).", "summary": "Just right as a water Enhancer", "overall": 5.0}

{"reviewText": "Classique Supreme is the second of the Melitta Gourmet Coffee Cafe Collection coffees I've tried. (I received free samples for review of the Classique Supreme and the Hazlenut Creme Brulee.) And I am quite pleasantly surprised.My coffee of choice to date, which I've been drinking for around 2 decades, is Peet's (which I get shipped to me as there are no Peet's outlets near me). Peet's sells several varieties which I like, and I always buy whole beans and grind them to make a cup at a time via a cone filter. When making coffee for 2 or 3 people I make each cup separately (using 2 or 3 cone filters at once). Also, I never drink straight coffee but always sweeten it (usually with honey) and add half & half (and sometimes French Vanilla International Delight).Melitta's Classique Supreme, as well as the Hazelnut Creme Brulee in the same line (and I assume all the varieties in their Cafe Collection line) are ground \"Extra Fine,\" and look to me to be finely ground enough to be used in an espresso maker (though I only make espresso - which I use in homemade lattes - with unflavored dark roasted coffees and the Classique Supreme is a medium roast). It looks and feels too finely ground to be used in a French Press (which I occasionally use for preparing coffee made from freshly ground beans, ground relatively coarse).So for testing/sampling purposes, I've been preparing the Classique Supreme (which I've drank several cups of over a couple of days) in a filter cone, using the exact measurements I use when preparing ground Peet's beans. And once I have sweetened and creamed the coffee to my taste, I cannot detect a difference in quality. The only difference I have noticed is that both varieties of Melitta's Cafe Collection that I've sampled leave me with less of an intense caffeine buzz than I typically get from the same size cup of Peet's (whether it's a medium or dark roast variety of Peet's). That's not necessarily a bad thing, for sometimes my second cup of coffee of the day (I usually drink 2 TALL cups a day) leaves me feeling a bit over-caffeinated (e.g., headachey or just off-kilter).The bottom line is that I like this coffee and given the relatively low price (e.g., at Amazon as well as Melitta's website), I'm motivated to try other varieties in Melitta's Cafe Collection line (particularly their darker roasts).I had difficulty opening both 11 oz. sample bags of Melitta Cafe Collection coffee I received - I found it impossible to open either bag without tearing holes in the upper half of each bag - so I called Melitta to comment about this. The customer service representative I spoke with said that Melitta recommends using scissors along the top of the bag.*(The phrase \"cup of joe\" supposedly came into vogue after Secretary of the Navy under Woodrow Wilson, Josephus Daniels, banned alcohol aboard navy vessels in 1914, leaving coffee the strongest drink on navy ships.)", "summary": "Makes a darn good cup of joe.*", "overall": 5.0}

{"reviewText": "When my son was first diagnosed, I tried making GF bread from scratch. I spend copious amounts of time and money on a variety of flours. When I found this mix, it was like a gift from God. I've since tried several other mixes, but none turned out as consistent a product as this mix. I do make some tweaks, however. I add a packet of unflavored gelatin (increases the protein content and helps with texture) and a teaspoon of xanthan gum. Often I will use my own yeast, just to make sure it's fresh. With these tweaks, I can easily make very good bread--without a bread maker (I have one, but I get much better results without it). I do find that I have to double the cooking time, but that could be from our area's temp and humidity and our oven.I've occasionally tried some variations, such as raisin and cinnamon, poppyseed, etc., with varying results. Overall, however, this is so much better than the awful pre-made, mass-produced shelf-stable breads, better than other mixes, and as good as many of the local freshly-baked GF breads that sell for eight dollars a loaf in our area. My son still likes his frozen bread for some sandwiches, but otherwise we often make this.Amazon's subscription-price is competitive, so we'll move to that!Updated to add that I no longer add xanthan gum to the mix, and the results are just as good.  With better proofing, my cooking time is only a little longer than what is listed on the box.

{"reviewText": "Nutella is a staple in my life, so, I was interested in comparing the Hershey's Chocolate with Almond spread to see if it measured up. Granted these are two different manufacturers, using two different types of nuts - hazelnuts versus almonds -- but the basic chocolate nut spread product idea is the same.Although the sugar content for both items is identical, Hersheys' spread tastes sweeter. The ingredient listing also revealed that Hersheys' listed nonfat milk before almonds, whereas Nutella listed hazelnuts, cocoa and then skim milk. This may explain why the almond butter flavor was less pronounced than the hazelnut flavor in the Nutella.At four grams, Nutella's saturated fat level is double the two grams listed for the same size serving of Hersheys' spread. At first I thought this might be because hazelnuts have a higher fat content than almonds but when I compared Nutella to Hershey's hazelnut product I found the same two grams of saturated fat so it appears it is because there are simply fewer nuts in the Hershey's spreads. The product is focused on the Hershey's chocolate taste, rather than nut butter.The Nutella has two grams of protein, Hersheys' one gram. Nutella has 21 grams of carbohydrate - Hersheys' has 23 grams. Nutella claims one gram of fiber, while Hersheys' claims less than one, otherwise calorie count, calories from fat are identical along with everything else.I was not happy to discover that Nutella contains artificial vanilla flavor (vanillin) and for a moment thought Hersheys \"natural vanilla flavor\" had them beat until I did a little research and discovered that the term \"natural\" is FDA mumbo jumbo denoting it is also artificial (real is the term to look for which indicates actual vanilla.) So, the difference in terminology appears to be caused because Nutella is a product of Canada, but bottom line is that both products use artificial vanilla flavoring.The Hershey's spread tastes chocolaty good, and was delicious on toasted bagels and even waffles. My preference is for a nuttier taste, but that is purely subjective.", "summary": "Hershey's Chocolate with Almond Spread", "overall": 5.0}

Caribou is a coffee company that is very popular in Chicago and are known for producing great quality coffee.  With their reputation, I've always been eager to try the other blends that are available in k cup form, but they are often hard to come by.I ordered a 5 k cup sampler size of this blend directly for Keurig because I was so happy with the Caribou Blend that I couldn't wait to try the company's other offerings.  I'm so thankful I did, because the Daybreak Morning Blend just hit the original blend out the park!I enjoy a medium roast with a kick.  Just because I don't like a dark, bitter cup of coffee doesn't mean I want to skimp on flavor or aroma.  And Caribou Daybreak really delivers in both of those departments.  This tastes like a fresh brewed cup that you'd pick up at a coffee shop.  It goes great with a little skim milk, too.  A perfect compliment to breakfast with a caffeine kick to get you going in the morning.The only downside to this blend is that I haven't been able to find it in store near us.  So we have to order it online, which seems a little pricier (surprisingly).  Oh well, I still think this blend is completely worth it.

{"reviewText": "A natural hair conditioner and a nice protective coating for the skin.  (and you can eat it too!)The oil is semi-solid at room temperature, and it's easy to scoop some out with your fingers (no warming or softening needed). It almost immediately turns to liquid on contact. In the container, the oil has a very distinct scent of coconuts, reminding me of macaroons or coconut-cream pie.  Once applied to skin or hair, the scent fades quickly.My GF really likes the oil as a conditioner, saying it leaves her hair silky and completely de-tangled.  She found it applies easily and not-messily. She applies it an hour before washing her hair (and commented that while it feels oily sitting on her hair during that hour, it's not \"bad oily\").  It washes out easily, usually one wash is enough. The conditioning effects seemed to last 2-3 days. The GF was very impressed.I also tried the oil on my skin.  It forms a protective layer (like a natural vaseline) rather than soaking-in and drying like a lotion.  That effect helps keep the skin from drying out, but isn't sufficient to re-moisturize dry skin here during the mid-atlantic winter. As the directions suggest, that makes it a better choice for elbows, feet, and other areas that just need some extra protection during dry months.Although I haven't tried this yet, since the oil doesn't dry up, but isn't greasy, it may be perfect for a lightweight massage oil.  Something to try next time the GF gives me a shoulder massage!I had been seeing a lot of buzz recently around coconut-oil products, and was pleased to have a chance to try this organic brand. It's a little funny to have a haircare product that's a reasonable skincare product that also, based on reading others' reviews, has many uses in the kitchen. Quite a versatile product![ I was given this product to review. I received no other compensation, and my review is my honest opinion. ]The best part is, unlike many big-brand health & beauty products, this product is not laden with mysterious or noxious chemicals-- just coconut oil.  I especially appreciate this after I spent several hours yesterday with EWG's SkinDeep database in an unrelated search for replacement personal care products that were both carried by Amazon and reasonably non-toxic (and still in my price-range).

The ingredients are 100% organic:  Organic Milk Chocolate (Organic evaporated cane juice, organic cocoa butter*, organic whole milk powder, organic chocolate liquor*, organic soy lecithin [an emulsifier], organic vanilla.  *Rainforest Alliance Certified cocoa.Personally I find most other chocolates create a dry feeling in my mouth.  I don't know how else to describe it.  They don't taste, feel or look as smooth.  Also they don't taste as sweet.  This chocolate tastes & smells wonderful.  I think the addition of vanilla might be what gives it that perfect touch.  I eat too much of it & order it by the case on Amazon as I have found that Amazon has the best price vs the few stores in my area that carry organic chocolate.If you like your chocolate sweet, creamy & organic then Newman's Milk Chocolate is for you!

Newman-Os do not give me a pain.Other cookie products made with cheaper stuff such as regular cornflour or high-fructose corn syrup cause me almost immediate pain in the joints, so I have to avoid them.There is some literature explaining a rheumatoid-like influence upon humans by high-fructose corn syrup, so please don't take my word for it;  please read up !!!I repeat:  great cookies!!

The My K-cup was the best of the lot for not leaking,But like I said above if the get the grind more toward the coarse side they ALL WILL WORK.Bottom Line:This product is great for storing pre-measured amounts that you have ground earlier in weekly batches.Make your measuring and grinding mess ONCE and then fill up 14 or so of these cups with your own recipe.If you want to get more accurate, instead of using tablespoons get a good digital scale for weighing.Note that if you are in a hurry then go ahead and DO USE THIS PRODUCT as advertised here.I just thought that these were too expensive also and that you had to keep reordering them.But yes go ahead and use them if you want to do that.", "summary": "I use these for air tight pre-measured storage containers AFTER I have figured out the correct grind and amount", "overall": 5.0}

The great news for single people and/or those who are extremely busy is that they are very simple and fast to prepare.Last Friday night, I prepared the Pearl Couscous (the Original) as a side dish for baked Tilapia.  I followed the directions on the box.  It gave me the option of using 1 2/3 cups of water or chicken broth.  For the first time, I used chicken broth to prepare pasta.In a medium saucepan, heat the chicken broth on high until the point of boiling, quickly add the pearl couscous, cover the sauce pace and lower the heat until it is simmering on low.  Let it simmer for approximately eight to ten minutes until all the broth has been absorbed.  Be sure to stir the pasta to prevent it from sticking to the bottom of the sauce pan.Let me say that this Pearl Couscous, like most all of the pastas from Side Mates, was packaged in a thick, aluminum pouch that I had to cut open with a pair of scissors.  It was a very protective pouch that kept the ingredients smelling fresh.  The box itself was composed of thick, strong cardboard.  It safely arrived in the mail.  Whether I purchase a food item in the store or order it online, its safeguarding and preservation is very important to me.The back of the box gave me a recipe for tilapia, which my girlfriend, Tammy, and I both love.  I bought tilapia, covered it with a can of Ro-Tel Diced Tomatoes with Lime Juice & Cilantro [Ro-Tel Diced Tomato Mexican Lime Juice and Cilantro, 10-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)], diced black olives, slices of lemon, and slices of American cheese.  I baked the tilapia in a Pampered Chef Deep Covered Baker (The Pampered Chef Deep Covered Baker for Oven and/or Microwave) for 35 minutes at 400 degrees Fahrenheit.Both the baked tilapia and the Pearl Couscous (the Original) tasted great together.  It is difficult to go wrong with these Side Mates All-Natural Family Side Dishes.  They taste well with most any meat.  However, I always look on the box for suggestions.

I am a trained aromatherapist and as such, am very familiar with the health benefits associated with lavender.

It is often used for insomnia in smaller amounts; in larger amounts has been used to increase mental activity. Lavender has been used extensively to treat burns and pain associated with sore muscles and joints. It helps restore hormonal balance and may reduce associated menstrual cramping. Lavender is widely used for respiratory ailments, colds, flu and sinus congestion. Added to a beverage, lavender is soothing for sore throats and laryngitis. Lavender stimulates the production of gastric juices and bile and thus aiding in treatment of indigestion, stomach pain, colic, flatulence, vomiting and diarrhea. Regular use of lavender essential oil is said to provide resistance to disease.UPDATE: Bebop Trading Co. is the absolute WORST vendor I have ever dealt with on Amazon.

My Great Grandmother, Grandmother, and Mother kept a candy dish full of these on their coffee tables. They also kept some in their purse and shared them with family and friends on outings. And guess what... I now have my own candy dish full of them on my kitchen counter. I have to restock it regularly because everyone that passes through grabs a handful. They go fast.

But they got their start in 1918 at the end of World War I when Lt. Bob McCormack decided to open a candy factory in Albany, GA, originally called Bob's Candies, and began making delicious candies, many of which were peppermint flavored. Bob McCormack soon became an innovative leader in the industry whose advice was sought out by others in the confectionery field. He was the first to wrap candy in cellophane and the first to use an automated machine to make stick candy. The machine was developed and patented by his brother-in-law, Gregory Keller, who was a Catholic priest. Bob also began using patented box and case designs that allowed his candies to be shipped safely.In 2005, Farley and Sathers purchased Bobs Candy Company and in 2012, they merged with Ferrara Pan Candy Company and became Ferrara Candy Company.FUN FACTS - Bobs produced the world's largest candy cane - an eight-foot striped cane that weighed more than 100 pounds, and in 1980, Bobs converted 100,000 pounds of sugar and corn syrup into two million candy canes - every day!", "summary": "INGREDIENTS; Soft, melt in your mouth mint that tastes great...", "overall": 5.0}

I mean sure they are like 2-3 times more expensive, but they are like 1.5-2 servings. Just be warned though, they are like a day's worth of sodium in each one. I never have these as a meal replacement, but just a midnight snack when I'm up studying. The spice also helps keep my awake which is a plus.

{"reviewText": "I was very skeptical when first trying the Iced VIA, particularly since, as others have noted, the addition of sugar (and NOT Splenda, alas) to the mix is clearly stated on the package.  Howver, this product turns out to be a huge win for me.  First of all, unlike the regular or decaf VIA which I also love (see my review ofStarbucks VIA Ready Brew Coffee, Decaf Italian Roast, 3-Count Packets (Pack of 6)), a single serving packet makes 16 oz., not 8 oz -- in other words, you get twice as much.  Second, if you just add a little milk or half and half (I use 4 Mini-Moos for one 16 oz. serving) plus a squirt of your favorite chocolate syrup, it's better than a Mocha Frappucino, and at a fraction of the price for a larger serving than even the large size bottles.  Even throughout the winter, this is my favorite way to start the day.  I'm saving a lot of money by no longer buying Frappucinos, not to mention the effort of lugging a case home from Sam's Club every week.  And the sugar content is LOWER than that of a Frappucino -- even if you add your own chocolate -- which pleases me.  In fact, a Mocha Frappucino out of the glass bottle now tastes too sweet to me.Amazon is apparently getting ready to offer a 50-pack case of Iced VIA, which is fabulous news -- I can't wait!  :)P.S.  To make it easier to prepare, I keep several recycled 16-oz. plastic water bottles in the fridge.  Each time I want a new 16 oz. cup of Iced VIA, I empty one bottle into aArc International Luminarc Working Glass, 21-Ounce, Set of 12with one packet of iced VIA mix and add half-and-half and chocolate syrup, then refill the bottle with tap water and return it to the fridge.  No need to use a measuring cup or fuss with ice -- the chilled water is always waiting for me and makes a perfect iced coffee each time!

Barilla swears on their web site that it's made to their high Italian standards though, so I guess that's good enough for me. Local production is good if it's actually good Italian-quality stuff.And this was good. So it just might be.Anyway, this one is a good choice.

The one negative I have with this product for skin is that it's so thick and hard, I really have to dig in there to get a bit; however, once it's in the palm of my hand, the warmth of my skin melts it quite quickly. It can feel a little heavy and greasy at first, and the scent of coconut makes me think of cooking and not \"beauty product;\" but I mixed it with a little of my regular hand/body lotion and that was the ticket - it smoothed on my skin quite nicely and created a kind of \"sheen\" like those starlets have on their skin as they walk the red carpet with an insipid grin. Mixing it toned down the coconut scent, too.I did smooth it on my face, straight, and it did absorb quickly, and the scent of coconuts wasn't so strong after a few minutes. I have slightly sensitive skin with a little rosacea and the product didn't break me out or irritate my skin.But! The best \"beauty\" use I had from this product that SOLD me, is what it did to my hair! One morning I smoothed the coconut oil on my hair, paying particular attention to the ends. I threw my hair up in a ponytail and left the coconut oil in for at least an hour and a half. I rinsed it out with very warm water and then I shampooed twice.

That sold me -- if I don't use this product for anything else, it's worth it for how it made my hair look and feel!UPDATE! - I bought another container of this to use in the kitchen - omg!

I have tried this variety (Zico) and the Vita Coco brand, which were comparable in price and quality.  Both were delicious, though only about half the people here at the office that tried it shared that opinion.  So young coconut water may be something of a specific taste.I'm a fan of coconut water (both Zico and Vita Coco) because they are very refreshing when served cold.  As they claim, it does naturally contain some of the same compounds found in sports drinks that are supposed to speed hydration (take that with a grain of salt...water hydrates just as well as anything).But best of all - 34 fl. ounces (1L) of (Zico/Vita Coco) coconut water = ~173 calories.

If you haven't tried it before I would recommend picking up a 3 pack from the store before you buy them in a large quantity (that's what I did, and now I'm hooked!).I usually mix one packet with 16oz (or slightly more) of water in a measuring cup and then pour it over a large cup full of ice.  Doing it this way you actually get 2 full glasses which, in my opinion, is more than enough.  I think I would actually be happy if the packets only made half as much and there were twice as many in a box but I guess if you don't want two full cups you can always just use half a packet.  I don't find the need to water it down any more than it recommends (aside from whatever ice melts into the drink) and I don't find it too sweet at all.

Further, I'm allergic to GMO corn starch (genetically modified corn starch)- and just try to find cookies in US stores without corn starch (and 95% of all corn is modified in the US, and does not have to be labeled so).  So these are a real treat for me- since they are a cookie I can actually eat.The cookies are flaky, as puff pastry always is, and slightly sweet.  As other people have said, this is not a terribly sweet cookie, but it is quite sweet enough.  I enjoy mine with tea, and I also take them in my lunch.

Adding 1 large egg and lots of butter, I made 20 medium (though on the larger size of medium) cookies. Recipe on the package stated to preheat your oven to 350 degrees. My oven was broken but I did have a toaster oven. I made my cookies (6 at a time), in my toaster oven, heating them to 350 degrees, and every set of my cookies were made in about 7 minutes. That's pretty fast! They rise very quickly, and I was so surprised how well they were made in my standard toaster oven (I have theCuisinart TOB-40 Custom Classic Toaster Oven Broilerbut any standard toaster oven will do).To finish off my cookies, I put powdered sugar in a ziplock bag, put 1 cookie in there at a time, closed it and crazy shook them. Final Results: Powdered sugar cookies! They tasted delicious (the more powdered sugar, the better). You can also add nuts (almond slices or coconut slices are best), as well as cocoa powder and cooking chocolate to make chocolate sugar cookies.Its also made in the USA with no preservatives, artificial colors, dairy, wheat, or gluten! At $3.83 plus the cost of the egg & butter, I did my math, and each cookie came out to roughly 25 cents, which isn't too bad when you have gluten restrictions. I hope eventually the price will go down the more gluten-free items become readily available. Betty Crocker Sugar Cookie Mix which is NOT gluten free runs about $1.98 when you get a case on Amazon.

The mint is subtle and blends perfectly with the chocolate. And there is a nice mix of textures with the crunchy cookie, mint creme and fudge coating.The downside: The fat content is VERY high. With 9g of fat (5g of that saturated fat) you get 14% of your recommended daily value of fat (25% of saturated fat) in one serving of three cookies.

However, everything always tastes better with a few spices added.I usually do not make this into a soup, just adding enough water to cover and then about 1/2 the resulting amount of stuff in the pot more of water, making this into a stove-top casserole. I then turn on the heat to start the cooking process. It takes about 30 min to cook thoroughly, generally. I usually have to stir frequently at first while the stove is heating up and then for a while after I turn down the heat to a simmer, just to keep the froth from building up. Stirring breaks up the bubbles. The froth is just carbohydrate dust and the cooking process breaks it down to carbon dioxide and water, thus the froth.I add small chopped pieces of veges when there is about 4 min more to cook. The water has usually been mostly absorbed at that time. Sometimes I have to add a bit more to keep the beans from sticking to the bottom during the last 4 min of cooking, and especially if I add some fresh veggies.

I've used other Knorr products over the years and recently brought back a couple of Knorr \"stockpots\" and \"gravy pots\" from the UK, not having seen them locally, so I was happy to tryKnorr Pasta Sides, Smokehouse Bacon Parmesan, 4 Ounce (Pack of 12)and quite enjoyed it as part of tonight's dinner.The first thing you might notice in looking at the package is a big notice in the bottom right corner that says \"No Artifical Flavors\" - something that is very important to me.  The package also claims that this product has the \"great taste of real bacon\" - and indeed it does.Each package makes about 2 servings and requires the addition of 1/2 cup milk and a tablespoon of margarine (I used butter), providing about 300 calories per serving, and takes just about 8 minutes to cook.A recipe on the back of the package suggests adding chicken and peas to the pasta dish to make a Smokehouse Chicken Carbonara to serve 4.  I liked the idea of those flavors together, but since I have no need to serve 4, I added the peas to the pasta (about 1/2 cup frozen) and made a Chicken Schnitzel as a main dish. (recipe below)  Dinner took me just about 10 minutes start to finish.  The pasta had a nice flavor, but nothing so overwhelming or \"sophisticated\" as to make it unacceptable to the younger set.Grandma's $0.02 - I really enjoyed the ease this pasta brought to my dinner and particularly liked the fact that there were only two reasonable portions.  This is something I definitely will purchase again. Two thumbs up.  Highly recommended.Here's my Chicken Schnitzel recipe -You'll need 1 boneless chicken breast half for each two servings. (I often cut these when I bring the chicken in from the market, then wrap each piece individually in plastic wrap and stack a bunch of them in a zipper freezer bag.  A single cutlet will thaw in just a few minutes on a metal surface.)  Remove any skin and bits of fat that might be clinging to the breast piece, then rest your non-knife hand firmly on top of the chicken piece to keep it from wiggling and slice horizontally through the middle of the breast to make two roughly equal pieces.  If you intend to freeze some, do that now.To cook - salt and pepper the thawed breast piece (allow 1 per person), then dredge each piece in seasoned flour. Dip into an egg beaten with 1 tablespoon of water, making sure to coat, and then dredge in bread crumbs, pressing them on if need be to cover completely.  (Remember the wet hand - dry hand trick so you have less mess.  One hand deals with the chicken when it is in the flour or breadcrumbs, the other \"wet hand\" puts it in and out of the egg wash.Just cover the bottom of a skillet with oil.  Fry each schnitzel about 3 minutes per side, until golden brown. Drain quickly on paper towel.  Serve with a lemon wedge.", "summary": "10 Minute Dinner!", "overall": 5.0}
